A typical 110v fan works at about 50CFM, with a noise level of 40dBA. <strong>These units have 40% more airflow than PC fans</strong>, which makes them a good choice for cooling small spaces (and also for DIY carbon filters such as this one).</p>\n<h3>12v PC fans</h3>\n<p>This is a basic and cheap solution for ventilation and cooling in Space Buckets. <em>PC fans are easy to find and recycle, and they provide enough airflow</em> to extract the heat from your garden. Keep in mind that in order to run PC fans you need a 12v power supply, which are also cheap and readily available. With 1A you can run 2 fans safely, though your mileage may vary and testing is always recommended. A typical 12v PC fan works at about 30 CFM (Cubic Feet per Minute) with a noise level of 26 dBA.

I've seen such discussions in multiple forums multiple times.</p>\n<p>Let's say we have a single LED that is a (theoretical) point light source.

It's a fibrous material that has excellent drainage, <strong>a soilless medium that has grown in popularity in the last years</strong>. In this guide I will walk you through my coco plant growing process.</p>\n<h3>General Usage</h3>\n<p>I use 5 parts coco coir and 1 part off-the-shelf perlite. I mix these thoroughly, until the mixture is as homogenous as possible. I next fill my pot(s) with the coco mix. Before thinking of planting, <strong>I flush the coco thoroughly with water at a pH of around 6.0</strong>. Coco works similarly to hydroponics. The coco itself has no nutrients, so it relies solely on what you put in. This a huge pro and also a con. It gives you ultimate control of nutrient intake. pH should be kept between 5.5 and 6.5, although I never stray outside of 5.8 to 6.2. <strong>Invest in a good pH meter.</strong>   Important tip: use Calmag! Coco coir tends to absorb and prevent the distribution of calcium. The solution is to add CalMag when adding nutrients, per the instructions (it's about 1ml / liter of water). It's pretty much impossible to over-water coco coir. If you add too much water it simply drains out of the bottom. You should aim to water the plant until you first see run-off, then add about 20% more water / water-nutrient mix. It should be flushed regularly as salts (aka the some of the nutrients you put in) will accumulate on the coco fibers. Water when the pot gets light in weight. I've learned to pick up the pot and feel when it needs to be watered. You might not be able to over water coco coir, but you can certainly water it too often. This can result in fungus gnats (minor nuissance), or other issues. I generally wait until the pot has lost 3/4 of its weight before watering. A full grown plant needs to be watered every 2 days. A smaller plant in a big pot may only need water every 7 days. Depending on you schedule, you'll likely be watering as follows: (Water with Nutrients, pure water, pure water, repeat). If you have deficiencies you can alter this schedule: nutes-water-nutes-water, or nutes-nutes-water.</p>\n<h3>Measuring PPM</h3>\n<p>I also invested in an TDS gauge. <strong>This measures the level of dissolved salts: nutrients and naturally occurring minerals in the water.</strong> The measurement is in ppm (Parts per Million). This gauge can help prevent nutrient burn by ensuring that the water you put in doesn't have too much nutrients. It's easy to use, and there are several guides online on what your ppm should be during various stages of growth (seedling, vegetative, flowering). I use the gauge to measure the water going in and the runoff out the bottom of the pot. If the ppm is too high I simply dilute the water+nutrient solution, recheck the ppm and pH, adjusting if needed.</p>\n<h3>pH Control and Nutrients</h3>\n<p><strong>I've been using Advanced Nutrients pH perfect and it's worked well.</strong> pH perfect is a bit of a misnomer: you still need to adjust the pH a bit for optimal results. Although I bought pH Down (Phosphoric Acid 85%) and pH Up, I've only ever used the pH Down. My tap water is at a steady 7.0 (lucky me). So, a few drops of pH Down are all that are needed to get the pH in the proper range. If I overshoot, I simply dilute my container with tap water so the pH goes back up and add a bit more nutrients. A few companies sell coco-specific nutrients. This goes without saying, but with nutes less is more. The only deficiency I've had was Calcium. Other than that, I've had nutrient burn more than once. <strong>I've adopted a new strategy of using as little nutes as possible</strong>, almost waiting for the plant to tell me it has a deficiency before adding nutrients. Unlike soil, you can change the nutrient conditions very quickly with coco coir. Since it's so porous and drains well, you can quickly add nutes or pure water to adjust any issues with the plant. With soil, you have to contend with whats in the soil already, which can often work against you. The downside is that you have to watch the plants like a hawk, since nutrient deficiencies or nutrient burn can happen very quickly.</p>\n","o":"14","d":"Coco coir is essentially made from coconut husks.

This unit of light alone tells nothing about the wavelength(s) of light, only the amount of PAR when measuring PAR in this unit.\nWe measure PPFD with a type of light meter called a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3yiwoSy\">quantum light meter</a>. Quantum in this case is not some gimmick marketing term but rather to emphasize that the meter is measuring the actual number of photons, the quanta or individual particle of the electromagnetic field, being radiated to a space (such as the top of a plant canopy).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/docs/lux-ppfd-conversion\">Learn more about Lux to PPFD conversions »</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/docs/lux-lighting-levels\">Learn more about optimal Lux Lighting Levels »</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>PPF (Photosynthetic Photon Flux)</h3>\n<p><em>This is the total light given off by a light source.</em> PPF is measured in µmol/sec or 'micromoles per second' also written as µmol s-1. <strong>Lumens is a close white light equivalent</strong>. PPE times the wattage of the light equals PPF.\nThere is some confusion about this term.

It is literally a metric of how many photons are being produced per joule of energy input. Top end grow lights put out about 2.4 umol/joule, while low end lights are about 0.9-1.3 uMol/joule.

If I have 400 umol/m2/sec of light for 16 hours per day then the DLI is 4 * 8.5 constant * (16/24) of a day = round up to DLI of 23 mol/m2/day.

The deeper reds is why CRI 80 and 90 have different lux to PPFD conversion values. Roughly speaking, a CRI 100 light has a luminous efficacy of around 250-260 LPW (lumens per watt) at 100% efficiency, CRI 95 is 280 LPW, CRI 90 is 300 LPW, and CRI 80 is 320 LPW. In the real world, these numbers can vary by 10% or so.\nThe higher the CRI number, the greater and deeper the red light we will have.

Higher CCT, having more blue light, will keep plants more compact at a given lighting level. 3000K and 3500K are pretty common for all around use. Roughly speaking, 2700K is 10% blue, 4200K is 20% blue, and 6500K is 30% blue.\nFor an artificial lighting source such as LED lighting, CCT is how white light is perceived. Cool white will have a higher blue light ratio and be at a higher CCT such as 6500K. Warm white will have a higher red light ratio and have a lower CCT such as 2700K. Higher color temperatures are common for vegetative growth since the higher blue light ration will help keep plants more compact.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/docs/mixing-colors\">Dive into color mixing theory »</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/docs/ultraviolet-growing\">Ultraviolet light growing considerations »</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>McCree Curve</h3>\n<p>This is a chart averaged of 22 different types of plants used in botany that <em>shows the amount of photosynthesis that occurs by wavelength</em>.

You'll rarely see BAR used but still it's important to know since in this definition far red light is included as well as UV light that may also affect plant growth and response. The numbers 280-800nm seem entirely arbitrary.</p>\n<h3>Joule</h3>\n<p>This is a <strong>unit of energy equal to one watt per second</strong>. Since a watt is volt times amperage you'll sometimes see this as VA for volt-ampere. If I have a 1000 watt light running for one second then 1000 joules of energy is consumed: if it runs for one hour then 3600 seconds * 1000 watts = 3,600,00 joules or 3.6 megajoules is consumed. So 3.6 megajoules is a kilowatt-hour (kWh) which is the unit of energy on your electrical bill. I pay about $.09 per kWh for my electricity which equals one penny for 400,000 joules of electricity.</p>\n<h3>eV (electronvolt)</h3>\n<p>For our purposes the electronvolt, or eV, is <strong>how much energy an individual photon has</strong> (although it is also be used to measure mass of electrons, protons, and the like due to mass-energy equivalence). Even though a photon has no mass it still has energy in the form of momentum. PAR photons have an energy range of 1.77 eV for a 700nm photon to 3.10 eV for a 400nm photon. One eV equals 1.602 * 10-19 joules of energy.</p>\n","d":"The topics below represent the core concepts in Horticulture Lighting Theory: learn about PAR, PPFD, PPE, CCT, McCree Curve and the Emerson far red Effect.

Growers can use light meters to measure the number of light photons that accumulate in a square meter over a 24-hour period. DLI is an important variable to measure because <em>it influences plant growth, development, yield, and quality</em>. For example, DLI can influence the root and shoot growth of seedlings and cuttings, plant quality (such as branching, flower number and stem thickness), and timing.

But, by not using a cover means we lose ingress protection leaving exposed voltages so there are potential safety concerns, and exposing the LEDs directly to the environment can potentially lower their longevity and the grow light's longer term reliability.</p>\n<pre> <img src='https://i.imgur.com/2LweZxA.jpg'/> <div> Historical, current, and projected LED efficacy</div> </pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The upper limit of LED fixture efficacy is determined by the LED package efficacy multiplied by four factors inherent to all fixtures: <strong>current droop, thermal droop, driver (power supply) inefficiencies, and optical losses</strong>. With current LED technology, the calculations indicate efficacy limits of 3.4 µmol J−1 for white + red fixtures, and 4.1 µmol J−1 for blue + red fixtures. Adding optical protection from water and high humidity reduces these values by ~10%. Paul Kusuma, P. Morgan Pattison &amp; Bruce Bugbee, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41438-020-0283-7\">From physics to fixtures to food: current and potential LED efficacy</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Keep in mind on LED grow light specs, some low end sellers may give specs (e.g PPF umol/sec numbers) for data sheet temperature and current ideal efficacy (i.e 25 C, lower nominal current), or may not take in to account LED driver losses when posting a umol/joule number, and not how the light actually performs in real world grow conditions. If low end style lights are giving specs better than high end lights, <strong>then don't don't do business with that seller</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Current droop</h3>\n<p><em>The greater the current though an LED, the less efficient it becomes</em>. This is one reasons why medium power LEDs in large series/parallel arrays (like the so-called quantum boards) have become common at least in the hobby community, and how COBs work by having a large series/parallel array of LEDs in a smaller common package. LED makers typical rate their LED at a <strong>'nominal' or 'sorting' current that may be significantly lower than what the LED is actually being driven at</strong> in real life. The <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/led/lighting/mid-power-leds/3030-leds/lm301h/\">Samsung LM301H LED</a> has their specs listed for 65 mA, but is rated for 200 mA continuous, for example.</p>\n<h3>Thermal droop</h3>\n<p><em>The higher the temperature of the LED, the less efficient it becomes.</em> LED data sheets typically give bin numbers for 25°C (77°F) or 85°C (185°F), and most LEDs are specified to operate at 85-125°C. The difference between 25°C and 85°C is about <strong>a 5% efficiency loss for most LEDs</strong>. Some 125°C continuous rated red LEDs can take a &gt;20% efficiency hit at 125°C. Higher temperatures will also degrade LEDs faster (particularly red LEDs), and cheap light bulbs are going to run their cheap LEDs very hot. Don't buy the cheapest light bulbs if you want them to last: you get what you pay for.</p>\n<h3>Driver (power supply) inefficiencies</h3>\n<p>Some low voltage DC drivers can hit about <em>98% efficiency depending on drive current</em>. There are AC LED drivers on the market that can peak at 97% efficiency. Some Mean Well LED drivers can hit the mid 90% efficient. Most of the AC LED drivers you find in products are going to be in the low 90% or upper 80% percent efficient, which can depend on specific LED current levels. <strong>Drivers with a lower power factor also contribute to greater inefficiencies.</strong> Cheap capacitors in cheap lights (particularly cheap light bulbs) is a major failure mode particularly with poor thermal management.</p>\n<h3>Optical losses</h3>\n<p>Using secondary optics (i.e a lens) over an LED can focus the light so an LED grow light maker can post some impressive PPFD (intensity) numbers right below the light, but the PPF number (total light output) is going to drop as well. <em>There will always be optical losses with a lens of perhaps 7-9%.</em> This same loss applies to grow lights that have a glass/plastic/silicon cover over the LEDs for splash proofing the light. If you grow hydroponically, and a prone to splashing hydro nute solution around, it may be worth it to take this inefficiency hit to keep the salt solution away from the electronics. Electrical safety is another very important reason glass covers are used for the ingress protection they provide.</p>\n","d":"The upper limit of LED fixture efficacy is determined by the LED package efficacy multiplied by four factors inherent to all fixtures: current droop, thermal droop, driver (power supply) inefficiencies, and optical losses.","f":"The  limit of LED efficacy is determined by <b>four factors</b>: current droop, thermal droop, driver (power supply) inefficiencies, and optical losses","i":[]},{"t":"Electrical Basics","s":"electrical-basics","c":"<p>This article provides the basic electronics knowledge you'll need to build a Space Bucket. This is an extremely short introduction to electronics, so if you're interested in the topic you would do well to read something more comprehensive. The best book for beginning electronics is Practical Electronics for Inventors by Paul Scherz. It's cheap, covers a lot of material, and doesn't assume any prior knowledge.</p>\n<h3>AC, DC and Power</h3>\n<p><strong>AC stands for alternating current and DC stands for direct current.</strong> An AC voltage is just a sinusoidally-varying voltage. You can still use Ohm's law with AC voltages and currents. The power delivered to the outlet in your home is an AC voltage, <strong>usually around 115VAC or 230VAC</strong> depending on where you are in the world . Often you'll want to convert the AC voltage from an outlet to a DC voltage, and that's what a typical DC power supply does. <strong>For example, the 12V wall wart power supply turns the AC voltage from the outlet to 12VDC</strong>.</p>\n<pre>   <img src='https://i.imgur.com/k1Wi5jZ.jpg'/> <div>GFCI protects you from ground path faults</div> </pre> \n<p><em>Electricity can be dangerous, especially to power coming from the wall</em>. Make sure you understand and take responsibility for your actions when working with mains electricity. Power tells us about how much energy we're using in a given amount of time. <strong>It's important to figure out whether we have a good enough heatsink, a big enough power supply, or fat enough wires.</strong> Power equals voltage times current, or P = I x V. Power is measured in Watts, abbreviated with the letter W. So say you have a high power LED with a 30V forward voltage and a 1A forward current. That means the LED dissipates 30W, and you'd need a power supply greater than 30W to drive it. Some of that power gets turned into light, and some of that power gets turned into heat. While LEDs convert a greater proportion of power to light than, say, incandescent bulbs, they still generate plenty of heat that must be heatsinked.</p>\n<h3>Voltage, Current and Ohm's Law</h3>\n<p><strong>Electricity is all about the flow of electrons to transfer energy</strong>. The best way to understand how this works is with the water analogy. Current is like flow; how much electricity is flowing through a circuit, or how much water is flowing through a pipe. Voltage is like pressure; the harder you push, the more flow you get. Resistance limits how much flow you get; a resistor resists the flow of electrons like a skinny pipe resists the flow of water.</p>\n<pre> <img src='https://i.imgur.com/c0KIOxJ.jpg'/>  <div>Ohm's law is the law for electricity. It's what relates current to voltage and resistance!</div> </pre>\n<p><strong>Ohm's law is the law for electricity</strong>. It's what relates current to voltage and resistance. Specifically, voltage equals current times resistance, or V = I x R. For a given resistance (measured in Ohms), the more current you'll get (measure in Amperes, or amps) for a given voltage (measured in volts). You might see these units expressed in units like millivolts or milliamps. These are just prefixes that act like multipliers on the units. For example, a milliamp is one one-thousandth of an amp. Volts are abbreviated with the letter V, amps with the letter A, and Ohms with the greek letter Omega.</p>\n<h3>Electrical Circuits</h3>\n<p>An electrical circuit is a closed conductive path for electrons to flow. <strong>If you connect a wire to both sides of a battery, you've made a circuit.</strong> Current flows from the positive side of the battery, through the wire, back into the battery's negative side. (This is called a short circuit. Don't do this). The most basic electrical circuit is a resistor attached to a voltage source, like a battery. The current through the resistor equals the voltage divided by the resistance, which we know because of Ohm's law. If there are multiple components in a circuit, we can figure out the current and voltage for each part using Kirchoff's laws.</p>\n","o":"4","d":"Learn the fundamental and basic electrical knowledge you need to build a Space Bucket or any DIY indoor garden.","i":[]},{"t":"Emerson (enhancement) Effect","s":"emerson-enhancement-effect","a":"SuperAngryGuy","c":"<p>The Emerson effect is about driving photosynthesis with part of the light PAR (400-680nm in this case), and part of the light far red color (700nm-740nm or so wavelength), <em>which combined can result in photosynthesis rates higher than normal</em>.</p>\n<pre> <img src='https://i.imgur.com/4ge0ohi.jpg'/> <div>Several recent studies have shown that far-red photons synergistically interact with shorter wavelength photons to increase leaf photochemical efficiency. <a href='https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/am-pdf/10.1111/pce.13730'>(source)</a></div> </pre>\n<p>Robert Emerson used his work with red and far red light to deduce that there must be <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosystem\">two photosystems</a>, called photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII)</strong>.

This confusion comes from biology books that show you a chart for pigments in a solvent or photosynthetic bacteria/algae, and not how higher green land plants actually respond to light.</p>\n<p>This has been used by many <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/C8LnVXf\"><strong>low end predatory LED grow light sellers</strong></a>, such as making outrageous claims about the photosynthetic performance of red/blue only LED grow lights, by hitting some 'magical wavelengths'. I have seen this claim collectively cause a lot of financial harm to people, and consumers may not be making good choices by thinking the <strong>spectral output of a lower wattage red/blue LED grow light is somehow going to make up for the low lighting levels</strong>: it absolutely will not!</p>\n<h3>The counterclaim (and what's really going on)</h3>\n<p><em>Most green light is absorbed and is used for photosynthesis</em>. Every scientific paper on plant lighting by wavelength for photosynthesis backs the claim that <strong>plants use green light</strong>.</p>\n<p>There is the claim that 'plants are green because they reflect all green light' or that 'plants can't use green light'. <strong>This can be explained with reflectance, absorption, and transmittance</strong>. You are likely going off the <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Chlorophyll-a-b-and-carotenoids-absorbance-spectra_fig1_317151195\">pigments dissolved in a solvent chart</a> if you believe this, and that's a relative absorption chart in vitro (e.g cuvette), not the <a href=\"/docs/mccree-curve\">McCree curve</a> that is an absolute chart of how plant leaves respond to light by wavelength for photosynthesis in vivo (living leaf). There is a pretty big difference here. Also, at no point is chlorophyll in a solvent truly at zero percent absorption of green light in higher resolution charts.</p>\n<p>Unlike chlorophyll in a solvent, <strong>in a green plant leaf we have relatively dense chloroplasts</strong>, containing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thylakoid\">thylakoid membranes</a> stacked as disks (grana), that holds the cholophyll in a 3D structure called a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantasome\">quantasome (basic photosynthesis unit)</a>. There is a much higher density level of chlorophyll in a leaf than chlorophyll in a solvent extract. So in vitro, with just relatively loose pigments suspended in a solvents, <strong>there is going to be a different measurement and spectral characteristics</strong> than in a green leaf in vivo, which is a dense solid lattice that changes optical characteristics (such as broadening the adsorption bands).</p>\n<p>In this example of the <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/2wgO4GS.jpg\">spectral reflectivity profile of a high nitrogen marijuana leaf</a>, about 90% of the green light is being absorbed.</p>\n<h3>Terashima et al has entered the chat</h3>\n<pre> <img src='https://i.imgur.com/SgP4sbt.png'/>  <div>Schematic of penetration of monochromatic blue, green, and red light. Green light may reach the bottom layer of cells due to the chlorophyll’s weak absorption in the green (the green window) and scattering of green light within the leaf (the detour effect). <a href='https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/68/9/2099/3857754'>(source)</a></div> </pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The intra-leaf light absorption profile is in most cases steeper than the photosynthetic capacity profile. In strong white light, therefore, the quantum yield of photosynthesis would be lower in the upper chloroplasts, located near the illuminated surface, than that in the lower chloroplasts. Because <strong>green light can penetrate further into the leaf</strong> than red or blue light, in strong white light, <em>any additional green light absorbed by the lower chloroplasts would increase leaf photosynthesis</em> to a greater extent than would additional red or blue light. <strong>Ichiro Terashima et al</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24043711_Green_Light_Drives_Leaf_Photosynthesis_More_Efficiently_than_Red_Light_in_Strong_White_Light_Revisiting_the_Enigmatic_Question_of_Why_Leaves_are_Green\">Green Light Drives Leaf Photosynthesis More Efficiently than Red Light in Strong White Light</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>What the team found was the green light started outperforming red light at about 300 uMol/m2/sec</em> as measured with a pulse amplitude modulated fluorometer. Red and blue light gets quickly absorbed by the chlorophyll near the leaf surface, <strong>but green is able to drive photosynthesis deeper</strong>.</p>\n<p>When I see people mentioning this is only for higher white light conditions, then I can tell they have not read the paper. We are looking at net photosynthesis rates in the above paper and that is what really counts, not absolute absorption. Also, <strong>the absorbed green light can transmit deeper through leaf material more effectively</strong> and potentially used for photosynthesis more efficiently.</p>\n<p>This is because the top layers of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroplast\">chloroplasts</a> that contains <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophyll\">chlorophyll</a> becomes saturated (as per <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PI_curve\">PI curves</a>), while green light can penetrate deeper into leaf tissue (sieve effect) and reflected around until absorbed by a chlorophyll molecule (scattering) or by an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessory_pigment\">accessory pigment</a>. This efficiency can be measured through the amount of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophyll_fluorescence\">chlorophyll fluorescence</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=gas+exchange+chamber&amp;biw=1138&amp;bih=505&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LI1nVabxI4GfsQWdpoHQDw&amp;ved=0CD0QsAQ\">gas exchange chamber</a>.</p>\n<p>So what high intensity light source has a lot of green light that plants evolved to use? <strong>The sun!</strong> At full sunlight <a href=\"/docs/core-lighting-concepts\">PPFD</a> of around 2000 umol/m2/sec would be considered very intense light compared to what the average indoor grower would use. With thin leaves (e.g. apple) <strong>I can measure perhaps 150 uMol/m2/sec of sunlight through an upper leaf</strong> that will illuminate a lower leaf with nearly all green light (which is a very efficient lighting level for photosynthesis).

So, it's true <strong>plants do reflect more green light than red or blue</strong>, but the way we perceive light is naturally much higher biased for green light with a 555 nm sensitivity peak, which is the same as a green plant's reflectivity peak. This allows use to notice very tiny variations of green which can be use to more precisely diagnose a plant if a gatherer. Coincidence?</p>\n<p>It should be noted that <strong>the maximum absorption wavelength for chlorophyll in leaves in vivo is 675-680 nm (chlorophyll A)</strong>, and not 660 nm as often cited (chlorophyll B is about 645 nm). This can be seen in the spectrometer shot as a dip in the 675-680 nm range from small amounts of chlorophyll A left over. The blue absorption are carotenoids which have perhaps a 30-70% efficiency at transferring the absorbed light energy to a photosynthetic reaction center through chlorophyll A. Depending on the plant, there may be 2.5ish-7 or so chlorophyll A molecules for every chlorophyll B molecule but mostly around a 3:1 ratio.</p>\n<pre> <img src='https://i.imgur.com/47jFDno.jpg'/> <div>Space Bucket with a high power green LED and a pole bean <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/HandsOnComplexity/comments/28gp4e/space_bucket_with_a_high_power_green_led_and_a/'>(source)</a>. </div> </pre>\n<p>The 30-70% efficiency claim (depending on type and the paper) about carotenoids is why I've always thought it is odd that any grow light seller would brag about targeting carotenoids. <em>Carotenoids are there to help the plant with intense lighting</em> and shunting some of the higher energy blue photons absorbed away from chlorophyll.</p>\n<h3>So...

It's pretty similar to this <a href=\"http://speclab.cr.usgs.gov/PAPERS/tetracorder/FIGURES/fig15-3.gif\">USGS reflectivity plot of green vegetation</a> <strong>but mine shows a much higher far red reflectivity</strong>. The error is in the way I'm making the measurement (since I'm not using an integrating sphere, gonionmeter or the like). It is going to read a bit high and much of the reflected light is going to be reflected right back on to the plant in a small Space Bucket chamber with the inside covered in highly reflective material.</li>\n<li><em>Transmission Plot.</em> <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/QxCRP3i.jpg\">The transmission plot</a> is spot on for perpendicular light relative to a typical pole bean leaf. What is interesting is that <strong>there's a transmission of almost 20% green light at 525nm</strong>, the peak wavelength out the green LED used. <strong>This means that the leaf beneath the top leaf has enough light to photosynthesize</strong>. 700 uMol/meter2/sec means that, minus the reflectivity of the leaf (most which gets reflected right back to bottom of the upper leaf), 140uM of light is illuminating a lower leaf at a lighting level that is very photosynthetically efficient.</li>\n<li><em>This leaves the leaf absorption amount</em> which is total light on target minus reflectivity minus transmission. Of the light that is absorbed by chlorophyll three things can happen: <strong>the photon get absorbed and used in photosynthesis</strong> (the energy of the photon unused in the PSI and PSII reaction center gets converted to heat); <strong>the photon gets absorbed but reradiated</strong> as a red/far red photon and a little heat known as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophyll_fluorescence\">chlorophyll fluorescence</a>; or <strong>the photon is absorbed</strong> and known as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-photochemical_quenching\">non-phytochemical quenching.</a>. Photosynthesis is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthetic_efficiency\">remarkably inefficient</a>!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\n<p>First of all, it is important to note that <em>in a small highly reflective chamber almost all the light is absorbed</em> by the plant when using LEDs.</p>\n<pre> <img src='https://i.imgur.com/SgP4sbt.png'/>  <div>Schematic of penetration of monochromatic blue, green, and red light. Green light may reach the bottom layer of cells due to the chlorophyll’s weak absorption in the green (the green window) and scattering of green light within the leaf (the detour effect). <a href='https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/68/9/2099/3857754'>(source)</a></div> </pre>\n<p>Now, most leaves are not perfectly perpendicular to the light source. You take the cosine of how out off perpendicular the leaf is to the light source in degrees, and factor in the refractive index of a leaf (1.41-1.47 or so) which drives off perpendicular photons deeper in to leaf tissue and too much math. The point being that <strong>you do get another layer of photosynthesis going</strong> on because the green light can penetrate the top leaf tissue with enough intensity to drive lower leaf photosynthesis.</p>\n<p>Look again at the transmission plot for blue light (which  is the left side of the graph to 500nm). Very little blue light is transmitted because of a class of photosynthetically active accessory pigments called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotenoid\">carotenoids</a> which can transfer light energy to chlorophyll with a 30-70% efficiency depending on the specific type of carotenoid. I've read elsewhere that it may be closer to 10% but this may be a specific type of carotenoid. So <em>on top of chlorophyll, there are other pigments intercepting blue light</em> resulting in not as high leaf penetration and very little transmission through the leaf.</p>\n<p>Look again at the transmission plot but for the red side. See that dip at 680nm? This is the peak absorption of chlorophyll in vivo. Most of this light gets absorbed in the top layers of chloroplasts leaving lower layers or lower leaves unlit. <strong>This rapid absorption is why in the McCree curve 590nm amber is showing a higher quantum yield than 680nm</strong>: it can penetrate deeper in to leaf tissue to be captured by deeper chlorophyll but not be absorbed but carotenoids allowing roughly a 15% transmission rate to the leaf below. 590Nm LEDs are electrically inefficient but is close to the peak of single phosphor warm white LEDs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/docs/green-leaves-green-light\">Learn more about green leaves and green lights »</a></li>\n</ul>\n","o":"3","d":"This article covers the optical characteristics of a pole bean leaf, grown in a Space Bucket indoor garden with a 100w pure green LED light.","i":[]},{"t":"LED Bulbs","s":"led-bulbs","a":"ekrof","c":"<p><strong>LED bulbs can be used for Space Buckets, and they are a good replacement for standard <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3jMfTYw\">CFL</a> builds.</strong> The main advantage of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3lyKIRa\">LED bulbs</a> is that you can keep the heatsink on the outside, avoiding many heat problems.

If I have a 100 watt COB that is 50% efficient (so 50 watts of heat) and want the heat sink to rise no more than 10°C, I would need a heat sink with a heat dissipation of 0.2 °C/W. If I use a fan it may be 0.4 to 2 °C/W, depending on how much air the fan pushes and the particular heat sink geometry.</p>\n<p>I often size heat sinks that <em>prevent the LEDs from going above 85-125 C for safety</em>, and then use a quite fan to keep them at a temperature I want them to be. This provides an inherent fail-safe feature when experimenting.My personal do not go over temperature is 145°F (63°C), or where I can keep my finger on the heat sink for an honest one second. For a Vero 29 running at 120 watts <strong>I use a generic $30 CPU cooler with a fan</strong> and call it good. I've seen coolers half that price that should also work.</p>\n<h3>Usage Tips</h3>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6063_aluminium_alloy\">6063 aluminum alloy</a> is the alloy with the highest thermal conductivity</strong> (around 210 W/m⋅K), and most common in heat sinks. The trade off is that 6063 is a softer alloy so common 6061 alloy (around 167 W/m⋅K) may be used instead in some cases. I've seen sellers advertise about using 'aircraft grade aluminum' like 7075 alloy for metal core PCBs for LEDs, which is inferior for our uses (around 140 W/m⋅K). For comparison, copper is closer to 400 W/m⋅K, and steel is closer to 45 W/m⋅K.</p>\n<p>It is critically important that a <em>thermal compound paste or thermal adhesive</em> is used between the LED and the heat sink. You only want a thin layer, and I always twist the LED around a bit to get rid of air bubbles and get better overall thermal contact. If it's a heat sink/LED I'll never reuse then I'll use a thermal adhesive and just glue the LED down. Thermal pads can work at lower power levels but won't work as well as a compound/adhesive.</p>\n<p>When <strong>making mounting holes</strong> in a heat sink you can use a stainless steel screw as a tap. Drill a whole just smaller than the diameter of the screw, force the screw in to the much softer aluminum cutting the threads in the process (I use a ratcheting screwdriver for this), back the screw out, take a fine file and smooth out the burs completely, and you have a drilled and tapped mounting hole.</p>\n<h3>Temperature Measuring</h3>\n<p>When working with a heat sink and a constant current power supply, you can monitor the voltage on the LEDs to see very tiny temperature variations that might not normally be measured with a temperature probe. With a constant voltage power supply, you can monitor the current to see very tiny temperature variations. This is because the I/V curves for LEDs are temperature dependent, and strings of LEDs make very high resolution temperature sensors. I use a 50,000 count data logging Fluke 287 for this purpose (I recommend a 6000 count multimeter for lower cost DIY. Every low cost meter I've ever tested reads within their listed specs when referenced to my Fluke 287, except for the occasional generic $5 meter that companies like Harbor Freight give away for free).</p>\n","o":"3","d":"I often size heat sinks that prevent the LEDs from going above 85-125 C for safety, and then use a quite fan to keep them at a temperature I want them to be.

It makes no sense to run plants at this level and it will reduce your yield. *   <em>Most plants saturation point: 1000-1200uM</em>. The saturation point is the lighting level where you just can't get anymore growth rate without adding CO2. A lot of this has to do with the effects of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorespiration\">photorespiration</a> in C3 plants like cannabis and non-photochemical quenching for all plants at higher lighting levels. If you just want high yield per area or volume without consideration of wattage, <strong>you should run you plants at this level</strong>.

I run plants around this level in flowering with CO2 enhancement.</li>\n<li><em>Most plants optimal point: 500uM</em>. Want high yields per watts claim? Run your plants at or below this level. Above about 500uM, plants start becoming CO2 limited in their growth rate but if you want good, tight nuggets this should be their minimum lighting level. This is why you need to use reflectors with CFL. Between about 50uM and 500uM the growth rate is linear with lighting levels. From 500um to 1000uM it's a compressed curve.</li>\n<li><em>Most plants compensation point: around 30uM</em> (I don't know the exact number for pot).

With this option, it is just a matter of putting the light on top of the lid and plugging it into the wall. <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>UFO LED grow light</a> are the <strong>plug and play solution for Space Buckets</strong>.</p>\n<p>These lights can be found in a variety of wattages. For the classic Space Bucket with 5gal containers, a <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>135w UFO LED light</a> is enough. For supersized builds that feature 10gal containers, 180w are a better option.

Though this is a viable option, <strong>it is better to install the UFO light outside of the container</strong>, which keeps the heat away from the growing chamber.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/gallery/1/ufo\">View 161 UFO build examples in the Gallery »</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>LED Bulbs</h3>\n<p><em><a href='https://amzn.to/3lyKIRa'>LED bulbs</a> have become an interesting option</em> for budget-minded bucketeers. <strong>The best bulbs for these kind of buckets are 8.5 to 10w.</strong> A LED-bulbed SB can be made following a SAG style build blueprint. In this case, 4 or 5 bulbs are installed vertically on the bucket lid. The plastic covers can be removed to optimize the bulbs lumen output, but for some newer models that is not recommended. <strong>For safety reasons, if the bulb has over 20 LEDs inside, it is better to keep the cover in place.</strong>\nOne solution to the <a href=\"/docs/led-bulbs\">problems caused by the uncovered LED bulbs</a> is to install a <strong>heat shield</strong>, which is fitted between the lights and the plant chamber. This is an essential upgrade for buckets that have high temperatures, and a great way to cover the exposed parts of the light fixture. The preferred material for heat shields is glass, which can be custom cut and stays cold to the touch. Acrylic or plexiglass can also be used, but is has to be monitored more closely (acrylic can melt or warp under high heat conditions).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/gallery/1/ledbulb\">View 19 LED bulb build examples in the Gallery »</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/docs/led-bulbs\">Read more about LED bulb safety »</a></li>\n</ul>\n","o":"2","d":"The Light-Top is the heart of a Space Bucket.

As a general rule, it is always better to use organic pesticides that are safe for human consumption, especially when growing plants like cannabis, hot peppers or cherry tomatoes. Do not use chemical pesticides if you plan to eat the fruits of your labor.</p>\n<h3>Neem Oil</h3>\n<p>Neem Oil is a safe and always recommended alternative pesticide. This is a vegetable oil that is pressed from the fruits and seeds of the neem plant. This oil, when sprayed on a plant, <strong>acts as a natural pesticide that repels a wide variety of insects, including spidermites and aphids, two of the most common pests. It also repels caterpillars, locusts, fungus gnats, ants, thrips, leafminers and more</strong>. Other than insects, Neem controls powdery mildew, black spot and rust fungi, all while being completely safe to mammals, birds and beneficial insects (like ladybugs). To apply Neem Oil it is best to spray the plant as with any other pesticide. Use the Neem oil to cover the entire plant, especially on the underside of the leaves, where lots of bugs hide. Repeat the process every 3-4 days fro two weeks and the plant should be pest free. You can also spray the soil, as the plant will absorb and distribute it along its tissue. <strong>Once the neem compound is present in the plant vascular system, the pests intake it during their feeding</strong>, and that is the end of them.</p>\n<h3>Diatomaceous Earth</h3>\n<p>Diatomaceous Earth is another great and natural tool to fight off pests, and it works great in combination with Neem Oil. <strong>DE is a soft, sedimentary rock that can be turned into a fine powder. It consists of fossilized remains of diatoms</strong>, a type of hard-shelled organisms. Among other things, it is used as a mechanical pesticide, and can be specially useful for controlling pests in small spaces. The fine powder of Diatomaceous Earth absorbs lipids from the insect's exoskeletons, causing them to dehydrate and die. This also works for other pests, like gastropods and slugs. Also pH is DE neutral, and because it is a mineral source of pH, <strong>it tends to stabilize pH in soil and hydroponics</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Top Soil Layer</h3>\n<p>One of the easiest and most effective pest control techniques is to <strong>put a layer of material on top of the soil of the plang: Diatomaceous Earth, perlite or aquarium gravel all work well for this application.</strong> Once the top part of the soil is covered, the pests ability to reproduce will be greatly reduced, interrupting their remaining life-cycle. Perlite is usually the best choice for this application, as Diatomaceous Earth can get muddy after a few waterings.</p>\n","o":"11","d":"Pests are one of the biggest challenges that a gardener has to face, and this is also true in DIY setups like Space Buckets.

We typically only want as much blue in a light source to help prevent any excess stem elongation. Blue photons have much more energy needed for photosynthesis, and <strong>this extra energy is wasted as heat that the plant has to dissipate</strong>.

Overall, <strong>the low blue light from warm white LEDs increased stem elongation and leaf expansion, whereas the high blue light from cool white LEDs resulted in more compact plants</strong>. The optimal amount of blue light likely changes with plant age because plant communities balance the need for rapid leaf expansion, which is necessary to maximize radiation capture, with prevention of excessive stem elongation.

Red photons have a lower energy with a higher theoretical PPE of about 5.51 uMol/joule (660nm) compared to blue of 3.76 uMol/joule (450nm). The higher efficacy is <strong>one reason why red LEDs are being added to white LEDs</strong>: what's held them back is their electrical efficiency (red and blue LEDs use different semiconductor material).</p>\n<pre> <img src='https://i.imgur.com/fKioXpt.jpeg'/> <div>Far red chlorophyll fluorescence imaging of a leaf showing damage not normally visible </div> </pre>\n<p><em>Far red causes greater stretching</em> like green light and contributes to the shade avoidance responses. It 'may' help put short day plants 'to sleep' faster. Far red may in some plants <strong>may be able to drive photosynthesis efficiently</strong> though the Emerson enhancement effect.

If you're using a chart with a really deep dip in the green/yellow/orange area then it's likely for algae or aquatic plants.</p>\n<p><em>The relative quantum yield chart is what we want to use</em> since it is a measure of how much sugar is produced. This is the correct chart for land plants and are the average of dozens of plants. Keep in mind that <strong>this is only for monochromatic light</strong> which below you'll see why may be problematic. These are relative charts and not absolute charts.</p>\n<pre> <img src='https://i.imgur.com/AiPFhLl.png'/> <div>For leaves grown in the field (solid) and in a growth chamber (dashed), normalized leaf yield relative to quantum of energy absorbed <a href='http://www.ecosearch.info/sites/default/files/prodotti_documentazione/TechNote126_quanti.pdf'>(original source)</a></div> </pre>\n<p>Although <strong>red light is generally most efficient in photosynthesis</strong>, <a href=\"/docs/green-leaves-green-light\">green light is also actively used in photosynthesis</a>. In fact, with a bright white light source it can be the case that adding more green rather than red or blue is how to increase photosynthesis efficiency. This is because <strong>green can reach in to deeper <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroplast\">chloroplasts</a> in the leaves</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Be careful of improper use of pigment charts</h3>\n<p>LED grow light manufacturers tend to use the solvent absorption charts which are wildly off in the green/yellow/orange area <strong>to boost their claims of very high yields per watt</strong>. It's all BS marketing. Look at the spectrum of HPS vs quantum yield charts and you'll see that it has a very high efficiency and not the 10% ballpark efficiency that is often claimed. For example, a 600 and 1000 watt HPS puts out around 215 and 358 PAR watts perspectively (this is 35.8% PAR efficient).</p>\n<p>LED grow light manufacturers also often use the incorrect chlorophyll dissolved in a solvent or algae charts <strong>to back their claims that specific wavelengths are needed for photosynthesis</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>The correct chart to use is <a href=\"/docs/mccree-curve\">the McCree curve</a></em> based on an average of 22 different plants which shows 550nm green is more efficient than 450nm blue (blue gets absorbed by some other pigments in addition to chlorophyll) and is the chart used in plant photobiology. The McCree curve is <strong>only valid at about 15-150 umol/m2/sec of monochromatic light</strong> and is most certainly not the be-all and end all-in in lighting spectrum charts. But, it's a good starting point and much more honest.</p>\n<p>If you find a chart with a deep dip in the green area <strong>then it's for some sort of algae or bacteria, not green terrestrial plants</strong>. If you find a chart with a bunch of chlorophyll and other pigment peaks then it's only valid as an extract in vitro (in the test tube or cuvette) and not in vivo (the living leaf itself). <strong>The pigment peaks can differ depending on the solvent used</strong> and the charts do not tell how much there is of a particular pigment so take them with a grain of salt. They are only valid for the particular set up used.</p>\n<details> <summary>View related studies and papers (21)</summary>\n<ul>\n<li>Květoslava Burda. <a href=\"http://www.foton.if.uj.edu.pl/documents/12579485/ac2f8322-d144-47f0-8f4b-322cd0f60fcf\">Why is photosynthesis interesting?</a></li>\n<li>McCree. <a href=\"https://www.vegenaut.com/pl/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/07/PPFD_essential_article.pdf\">The Action Spectrum, Absorptance and Quantum Yield of Photosynthesis in Crop Plants</a></li>\n<li>McCree. <a href=\"http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/plantphysiol/49/5/704.full.pdf\">Significance of Enhancement for Calculations Based on the Action Spectrum for Photosynthesis</a></li>\n<li>Vaia Sarlikioti. <a href=\"https://edepot.wur.nl/183133\">Modelling and Remote Sensing of Canopy Light Interception and Plant Stress</a></li>\n<li>Donald R.

Even if the plant is a tree, a SB can function as a highly effective growth chamber: tree saplings can be started indoors to strenghten them before planting in an outside location. <strong>Bucket gardens also have great performance for all kinds of cuttings and clones, and can be used to sustain plants during the winter time.</strong></p>\n<pre> <img src='https://spacebuckets.com/u/cherry-tomato-journal/3f341a.jpg'/> <div>Cherry tomatoes love to grow in Space Buckets</div> </pre>\n<h3>Cannabis</h3>\n<p>This species is the most popular among bucket gardeners for a variety of reasons. <strong>Cannabis plants require optimum lighting and enviromental conditions</strong>, which can be easily controlled inside a small enclosed container. Bucket cannabis plants are typically vegged for about a month while training agressively, and then flowered according to the strain. The most difficult part of growing this plant inside a bucket is controlling the flowering stretch, which can multiply the height three fold. Techniques like topping and LST are absolutely essential for cannabis in SB.</p>\n<h3>Cherry Tomatoes</h3>\n<p>This is one of the most rewarding plants that can be grown in a Space Bucket. <strong>Cherry tomatoes are relatively easy to grow, and can produce many fruits in a short period of time</strong>. There are many varieties available and all work well with SB, given their naturally short stature. Cherry tomatoes can be pruned, topped and trained, which will be essential for a good bucket performance. As with hot peppers, it is recommended to pollinate cherry tomatoes manually, gently shaking the branches or using an electrical toothbrush to distribute the pollen.</p>\n<h3>Hot Peppers</h3>\n<pre> <img src='https://spacebuckets.com/u/bucket-potatoes/9a8a6f.jpg'/> <div>How about some bucket potatoes?</div> </pre>\n<p>SB can be used to grow every species of hot peppers, and a lot of bucketeers choose this plant. <strong>Variants like habanero and jalapeño are especially popular among bucket gardeners</strong>. These plants don't need a very aggressive training, though they benefit from LST and HST techniques. Some topping is usually required, and manual pollination is recommended to increase the pepper yields. The lighting schedule depends on the specific strain, but 12/12 is a safe bet. Reddit communities like /r/HotPeppers are a good resource for these kinds of plants.</p>\n<h3>Herbs and Greens</h3>\n<p>Space Buckets can also be used to grow all kinds of herbs: these plants have great performance and are much easier to maintain, as they general don't require any training. Harvest is much more regular, because the important parts are the leaves and not the fruits or flowers, which are harder to produce. <strong>Some examples of great bucket herbs are basil, chives, dill, rosemary, oregano, mint and more.</strong></p>\n<h3>Other Plants</h3>\n<p>Over the years, bucketeers have experimented with many plant species, like strawberry, potatoes, wasabi and even an avocado sapling.

Plant training is an essential tool for this hobby: untrained plants will outgrow their buckets if you let them.</p>\n<pre> <img src='https://i.imgur.com/sB1x3pC.jpg'/> <div>Hot peppers are a great plant to practice trainig techniques.</div> </pre>\n<p>Plant training techniques can be divided into two: <em>Low Stress Training</em>, which includes bending, tucking and guiding the stems; and <em>High Stress Training</em>, which purposely stresses the plant to make it heal.</p>\n<p>LST can be started early in the life of a plant, and it is specially useful for cannabis and hot peppers. As the plant gets older, it stem hardens, which makes the training more difficult. HST techniques pose a higher risk of failure, but sometimes a bigger reward. These methods have a drastic impact on the plant, and require a few days of healing time. All of the following techniques are recommended for gardening in small spaces, and sometimes inevitable.</p>\n<p>For growing in a Space Bucket, <em>you need to train the plant to grow as horizontally as possible</em>. If you can keep your plant flat and with an even canopy, the lighting inside your bucket will be more effective, and you'll get better yields. That being said, <em>every plant is different</em>, and there are many factors that influence its performance.</p>\n<h3>LST: Low Stress Training</h3>\n<p>The most basic form of training implies <b>bending the stems of the plant to make it grow in a horizontal fashion.</b> This can be achieved with hooks that wrap around the stems and into the soil. With this method, the plant grows into a bush form, creating a more even canopy, something that is very important for gardening in small spaces. It can be hard to predict the growth pattern of a plant, so every new hook needs to be strategically planted along the way.</p>\n<pre> <img src='https://i.imgur.com/HHO4jbYh.jpg'/> <div>There are many ways to train a plant, and some approaches defy categorization.</div> </pre>\n<p><em>Tucking leaves is another useful LST technique</em>, and a good alternative to pruning. In this case, <strong>the idea is to pull leaves that are blocking important parts of the plant, like flowering tops.</strong> Instead of removing the leaf, it can be tucked behind a stem, exposing a part that needs to be emphasized. This is usually better than pruning, as it does not require healing time and allows the plant to use the nutrients stored in the leaf. In situations where tucking is impossible, a bit of prunning can be useful, but only removing a few leaves at a time.</p>\n<h3>HST: High Stress Training</h3>\n<p>Topping is the main HST technique in a bucketeers arsenal. <strong>This method requires removing the topmost growth of the plant</strong>, which forces it to grow in a bushier kind of tree. When applied early, <em>topping alters the canopy significantly, and limits the height of the plant</em>.</p>\n<p>This training technique can be used multiple times, and every time it will multiply the number of branches. That being said, there is a limit to how much you can top: for most of the cases, between one and three toppings will be enough for a very short plant. Because it removes unwanted parts of the plant, topping results in a cleaner, more predictable training.</p>\n<p>Even though topping is a powerful tool for plant training, it is a High Stress technique, and as such <strong>plants usually need a few days of healing to recover</strong>. During those days, further training is not recommended. Also, keep in mind that <em>not all plants react positively to topping</em>, so research species characteristics before using this or other HST techniques.</p>\n<p><em>Supercropping is another useful tool</em> for controlling the plants growth and training its canopy: in its simplest form, <strong>it means pinching the stem to force the plant to heal its internal structure</strong>. Once healed, this results in ber and faster growth. The most important part of supercropping is to avoid breaking open the stem, you need to crush it just right. A whole branch of the plant can die if the supercropping is excessive.</p>\n<p>Supercropping <strong>tends to be considered a controversial technique</strong>, given its high stress methods. As with topping, not all plants react positively to this kind of training. Supercropping is recommended for gardeners that already have some experience in plant growing, or for high stakes situations, when the bucket is about to be overgrown.</p>\n<h3>Plant hormones</h3>\n<p>Plant growth hormones (also known as phytohormones) <strong>play the dominate role in plant structure and development</strong>.

I just want to minimize that risk</em>.</p>\n<h3>Use a GFCI!</h3>\n<pre> <img src='https://i.imgur.com/QqDfGit.jpg'/> <div>GFCI protects you from ground path faults</div> </pre>\n<p>That's <em>Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter</em>. You have electricity and a lot of moisture: that could be a bad combination. <strong>GFCI protects you from ground path faults.</strong> In other words, it prevents serious shocks from the wall power supply, through your body and to ground. Literally, this means a ground path to earth itself or a ground path to an object at ground potential. Twice I've had GFCI protect me from being severely shocked. You'll still feel a slight tingle but that's it. No dying, though. How cool is that!\nGFCI does not protect you from hot and neutral wire shocks because it only <strong>shuts the circuit off if there's a current imbalance between the hot and neutral wire.</strong> If there is, it means current is going to ground when it's not supposed to. That's bad- it could be going through your flailing and thrashing body. A GFCI circuit does not require a ground wire to work. GFCI can be found in breakers, receptacles, power strips or adapters. How much is your life worth?</p>\n<p><em>Wet concrete floors are bad!</em> Get them off the floor and get yourself off the floor. It's just another safety thing to keep in mind. Wet concrete has a bad habit of conducting electricity. <strong>Play it safe and think of wet concrete as standing in a mud puddle from an electrical safety stand point.</strong> This is why it's a good idea to have GFCI protection in garages.</p>\n<h3>Sockets need to be wired the right way</h3>\n<p><em>I don't care if it is just two wires. One is the hot (black) and one is the neutral (white)</em>. If you have a brown and blue wire, it's almost always the case that the brown is the hot and the blue is the neutral. You'll see this in some appliances and extension cords depending where you live in the world. If the socket has pig tails (it's own wire sticking out), it's always hot wire to socket black wire and the neutral wire to the socket white wire. <strong>NO EXCEPTIONS!</strong> If there's screws instead of wires, the brass/gold colored one is for the hot wire and the silver colored one for the neutral wire (more below on this). Why is this so important? Because when you screw in a bulb there might be a little metal exposed at the bulb's base.</p>\n<p>Wired backwards and you have an energized metal part exposed (bad). Wired correctly and you have a exposed metal part at ground potential (better). <strong>Wrap any exposed with a little tape and you have very good.</strong> If you have a lighting socket with 2 of the same colors coming out, the neutral will be connected to the socket side threads, the hot connected to the metal piece deep in the center of the socket. In this case you need a continuity tester or multimeter to determine which wire is the neutral.</p>\n<h3>Splice wires correctly!</h3>\n<pre> <img src='https://i.imgur.com/EleaEp8.jpg'/> <div>Wire nuts are easy and safe to use</div> </pre>\n<p>With Space Buckets you're going to run in to situations where a junction box may not be able to be used so here's some open air splicing tips. <strong>If you can pull the wires apart then you have a bad splice</strong>. <em>The preferred way is using wire nuts</em>. Strip your wires 5/8ths of an inch, put them in the opening and twist until you can't anymore. There's a spring inside that tightens the wires together. It's not necessary to twist the wires first. You should, however, tug on each wire to make sure it's well connected after the wire nut is twisted on. Tape the wire nuts up. You should so no exposed metal parts from any angle.</p>\n<p><strong>The second way is a butt splice</strong>. They’re sometimes called <strong>splice crimps</strong>. Strip wires, stick them in and use pliers to crimp the aluminum tube inside as hard as possible. There are special pliers for this but any pliers can do. Again, tug on the wires to make sure they're secure and tape as needed.</p>\n<p><em>The third way is tape and solder</em>. Twist the wires in a rat-tail splice, solder them up and use a higher quality electrical tape preferable <strong>Scotch Super 33+</strong> to wrap them up. 33+ has an adhesive that hold under a wide range of temperature and humidity. Low quality electrical tape has a bad habit of becoming undone at higher temperatures and humidity. <em>Twist and tape alone is not recommend for line voltage splicing</em>. The same with a T-splice unless tape and solder is also used.</p>\n<h3>Secure those wires!</h3>\n<p>This means <strong>additional stain relief and to preferably use tie wraps</strong> to secure the wire to the bucket's lid. Drill 2 small holes just big enough for the tie wrap and secure the wire to the lid that way. Sticky backs can also be used. Use some 5 minute epoxy if needed to secure the sticky back. Even it everything feels snug, it may actually be 1 or 2 out of 3 that are snug. Loose connections means fire. <strong>Push the male prongs together to the point that you have to do a little wiggling to plug something in.</strong> This is really more critical wire higher current loads like electric space heaters, HPS lighting and the like but a good habit to get in to.</p>\n<p><em>Never use line voltage at canopy level!</em> If you use LED intracanopy lighting, <strong>use a lower voltage to drive them.</strong></p>\n<h3>If using foil as a reflector, ground it</h3>\n<p>With three conducts you'll typically have a black, white and green (or brown, blue, green or green with a yellow stripe depending where you live). <strong>That green wire is your grounding wire.</strong> Metal parts should be bonded to this green wire.</p>\n<p>You can use a screw/nut/washer through the bucket side, through the foil and put the green wire under the washer preferably with a fork terminal stake on. If you're connecting wires to a light socket with the gold/silver screws mention above, this is the preferable way to connect the wires. Put tape over the screws with some 5 minute epoxy to make sure the tape stays in place. <strong>The best inside the bucket reflector is flat white paint with barium sulfate added</strong>. It'll be in the high 90% range.</p>\n","o":"5","d":"Follow these safety guidelines to make your that your DIY indoor garden is following the best electrical practices.","i":[]},{"t":"Smell Control","s":"smell-control","a":"ekrof","c":"<p>Controlling odors and smells from smelly plants is a very popular topic among indoor gardeners, and Space Buckets are not the exception.

There are many versions of DIY filters floating around the Internet, but none has proven to be really useful. The general idea is to stack two pencil cup holders with activated carbon in between. The problem is that PC fans are not powerful enough to make a difference, and even line-voltage fans will struggle to move the air through the carbon. A very powerful fan may be sufficient, <strong>but at that point an inline fan would be a smarter choice</strong>.</p>\n<h3>ONA gel</h3>\n<p>One supplemental option for activated carbon filters is <em><a href='https://amzn.to/3yKqDgU'>ONA gel</a>, a material that masks the smell in the room that is present</em>.

For example the hypocotyl (the stem before the first set of true leaves) can react much differently than the epicotyl (the stem after the first set of true leaves) in some plants like pole beans in my 470nm vs 405nm experiments.</p>\n<h3>Safety Considerations</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em>UV-A light (315–400nm) is fairly safe</em> (it can be dangerous when you stick your eye close to a light source that appears dim yet has a high radiant flux) and at the time of this writing, only UV-A LEDs are used in LED grow lights if UV light is used.</li>\n<li><strong>The UV-B (280–315nm) light sources</strong> I've seen in grow lights are still tube based because UV-B LEDs are still inefficient (5-10% range).</li>\n<li><em>UV-C (100–280nm) should be considered dangerous</em>, and in testing I have damaged a number of plants with higher amounts of UV-C.</li>\n</ul>\n<details> <summary>View related studies and papers (4)</summary>\n<ul>\n<li>Chen et al. <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2019.01563/full\">UVA Radiation Is Beneficial for Yield and Quality of Indoor Cultivated Lettuce</a></li>\n<li>Loconsole and Santamaria. <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348591781_UV_Lighting_in_Horticulture_A_Sustainable_Tool_for_Improving_Production_Quality_and_Food_Safety\">UV Lighting in Horticulture: A Sustainable Tool for Improving Production Quality and Food Safety</a></li>\n<li>Romen Naorem. <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Romen-Naorem/publication/303989688_The_Secret_Beauty_of_Ultraviolet_Radiation_in_Plants/links/5761eb0208aeeada5bc5033a/The-Secret-Beauty-of-Ultraviolet-Radiation-in-Plants.pdf\">The Secret Beauty of Ultraviolet Radiation in Plants</a></li>\n<li>Jansen et al. <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1360138598012151?casa_token=yDXAFPKqbcUAAAAA:7sM5p_1Sm4gza7fgszCOFUHorQmGyyqZsKUiC2edeunkgm9wQNxWdaxRUb94nCckY3naOZSLx3s\">Higher plants and UV-B radiation: balancing damage, repair and acclimation</a> </details></li>\n</ul>\n","o":"3","d":"Adding UV LEDs (with about 100 to 400nm wavelength) are typically only used for light sensitive protein reactions effects, not as photosynthesis drivers per se.
