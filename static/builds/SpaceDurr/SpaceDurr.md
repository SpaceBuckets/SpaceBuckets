c: "This is my bucket build! It was inspired by <a href='/u/Morrigan_Disapproves'>/u/Morrigan_Disaproves bucket</a>. I'm using an Apollo 180W UFO and I recently picked up some warm white LED strips that I'll install this weekend. I reversed the fan and mounted it with spacers to a bucket lid and secured it in a spacer. I then added a 4' outlet to connect to the flex duct. I also removed the power input from the UFO and integrated it into the lid for a cleaner look.
I might even try to do something with arduino which could use the controllers to trigger alerts if it falls outside of range. That's something for the future though.
Finding out about space buckets has reignited my love of hydroponics"
