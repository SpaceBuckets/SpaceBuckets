c: "This is Artemis, my grow bucket! This is a simple and effective design: the bins are placed one atop each other, and gravity holds them together. I reversed the 3 fan placed atop the <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>UFO LED light</a> to push air out. I also use an inline fan which is placed atop the bucket. I've not had much experience with the UFO's performance yet as this is my first grow (wish me luck). For odors I am using a carbon filter."
