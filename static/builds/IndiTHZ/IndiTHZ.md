I am using a <strong><a href='https://www.amazon.com/MarsHydro-Spectrum-Hydroponic-Indoor-Growing/dp/B00XC3LBI2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1514055656&sr=8-4&keywords=300w+led&linkCode=ll1&tag=spacbuck-20&linkId=d3b5a0c12a501f7dd770ca5cd66f8580'>300w UFO LED</a> as the main lighting</strong> for my garden. I also have a 120mm exhaust fan for airflow. The heat mat keeps temps in the mid 60s at night (it gets cold the winter months). Inside the tote I lined the sides with windshield reflective mylar, and I have a circulation fan mounted in the corner."
