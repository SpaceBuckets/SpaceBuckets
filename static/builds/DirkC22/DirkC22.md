c: "Here is my garden! <strong>I'm testing it right now</strong>, not fully finished with it. I have a passive intake, PVC 90 degree bend that I tried to use to cut down light leaks. I'm using a <strong>4' inline fan with filter</strong>, and a fan control. With it on the lowest setting and the <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>UFO LED light</a> fan reversed the temps are running about 5 degrees hotter than room temp. Have a cheap humidity/temp sensor. Smart pot 3 gal inside. Used mylar blankets and spray adhesive to finish off inside. <strong>Thanks for looking!</strong>"
