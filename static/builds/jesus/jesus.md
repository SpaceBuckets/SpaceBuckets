I'm still waiting for fans. <strong>I went from finding out about this community to building my bucket in just 3 days.</strong> I'm using the standard build with 5gal buckets and 4 <a href='https://amzn.to/3jMfTYw'>CFL bulbs</a>. After the fans arrive  I can finalize the socket placement and run the wires more cleanly."
