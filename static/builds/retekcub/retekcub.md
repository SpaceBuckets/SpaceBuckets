c: "I want to thank all of the other space bucketers for sharing their experiences. <strong>It truly does inspire and inform.</strong> For this bucket I'm using a 130W LED UFO with a 5630 LED strip (plan on making a spacer with this attached). The exhaust is a 110cfm 120mm fan. I made a DIY carbon filter with a JIF jar. Not sure if it will work but in theory I think it should. I can feel a bit of blowback near the exhaust when I attach the empty filter so I may have to redesign this."
