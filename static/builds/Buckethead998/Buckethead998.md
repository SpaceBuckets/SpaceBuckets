Currently gone thru 4 buckets one of the main body, one for lights and drain pan and two more for spacers. One intake and one out take fan running off a 12v 1a power supply. <strong>I plan on making a carbon exhaust using the fan grills</strong> I have, plus some dead pc fans if I can find any. I wish I would have take the time to sand down the fan mounting areas a bit more. I know I am losing some airflow. <strong>Also: it's amazing how much tape it takes to black out a bucket!
