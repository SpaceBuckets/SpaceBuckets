    <h3>BUCKET FEATURES</h3>
    180W Apollo <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>UFO LED light</a>, secured on the inside of the bucket to the lid. I reversed the fan so that air is pulled through the light and exhausts out of the top. I'm also using 5m <a href='https://amzn.to/30TZOZn'>5630SMD LED</a> strips.
    Four 80mm computer fans, two intake and two exhaust. The fans vary in speed, and I initially intended to construct carbon filters over the two exhausts. I've since learned and found that these fans are definitely not strong enough to push/pull air through a proper carbon filter.
    Mylar interior, Plasti-dipped exterior. I like the look of the plasti-dip, although it needs a couple more coats. I sanded down the buckets first, and had a couple issues with it peeling where I made additional holes in the bucket after spraying. The mylar is secured using spray adhesive."
