My confidence in attempting this was also helped by the excellent tutorial provided by bucketeer <a href='/u/bucketoflight'>/u/bucketoflight</a> in this take of the SAG LED Bucket. Right now I'm trying to get a clone going in it, but if that doesn't pan out, I'll probably just try bagseed again. Let me know if you have any thoughts or suggestions! <strong>Overall, I'm very pleased with how it works.</strong> I plan on ordering side LED lighting for both buckets."
