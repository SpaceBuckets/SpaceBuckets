c: "With the help and encouragement from <a href='/u/ekrof'>ekrof</a>, the grand bucketeer, I decided to make a heat shield. <strong>Until now there were no tutorials</strong>, so I wanted to share my progress! The temps are stable thanks to the shield: between 70 and 75 with the humidity fluctuating only slightly from 45%. The humidifier is no longer necessary. In order to get the glass shield, I had to call a local glazier. They had the 13' circle of 1/4 inch glass cut in an hour. <strong>This size proved perfect</strong> for the standard 5gal buckets. I used evenly size marbles to hold the glass level while I added both super glued L brackets and liquid nails around the edges. After it dried over night on the spacers, I could turn it over and <strong>seal the other side.</strong>"
