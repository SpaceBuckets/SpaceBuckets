c: "<strong>I love you Space Bucket folks!</strong> Here are my build specifications. I used a 32gal Brute trash can with lid, the inside is coated with reflective/metallic tape. <strong>For lighting I'm using 8 CFL bulbs which are really bright.</strong> I added a false bottom for drainage purposes, as well as a temperature and humidity gauge to keep things in order. I have one big 6' intake and two 3' exhaust fans, which are connected with a metal T-duct. I have activated carbon sandwiched between two screens at the opening of the exhaust port to cut smell. <strong>And finally, a bunch of random cheese stickers I will probably take off at some point.</strong> Any recommendations on functionality, light/air tightedness, aesthetics, or whatever else greatly appreciated."
