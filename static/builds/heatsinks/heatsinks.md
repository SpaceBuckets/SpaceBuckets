In the end I chose 29.5V which added up to ~95W for each LED. It was really cheap compared to some of the LED UFOs out there. <strong>The fans weren't all that expensive, the LEDs were amazingly cheap</strong> (and I'm sure they could be found cheaper on other sites), and even the power supply was pretty cheap. It just takes a lot more setup compared to UFOs.
I wear a welding helmet while working with the LEDs on. They are just way too bright for the naked eye. I'm fully convinced that looking into these is just as bad as staring into the sun - after a period of time it will blind. Even looking at them for a second or two puts spots in my vision and makes my eyes sore, <strong>so don't mess around them without proper protection!</strong>. <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceBuckets/comments/2z8jyu/new_lighting_endeavors/'>More discussion at the reddit thread.</a>"
