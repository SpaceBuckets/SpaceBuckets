c: "This is my bucket garden! I did all the wiring with connectors so I could open the bucket up without all the wires all over the place. I have a led ring with 5630SMD and a LED lid that I shuffle around when needed. I have a lid that is just a fan that I got out of a pinball machine and works wonders. A drip watering system really helps when the plant gets past those first few rings and I highly recommend installing one."
