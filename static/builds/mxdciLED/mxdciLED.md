c: "This is my new Space Bucket build!<strong> I decided to upgrade to a Super UFO LED light</strong>, and I have to say that I love it. It is a Growblu with 144 true watts, which should give me great results. The setup has been running for a few hours and its in 80-87f at the moment. I have yet to invert the fan in the ufo to extract heat, hopefully that will make a difference. Thanks for looking!"
