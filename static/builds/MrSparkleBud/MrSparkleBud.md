c: "This is my bucket build! Itâ€™s a 5gal container lit up with three A19 style <a href='http://amzn.to/2q0RSB8'>8.5w soft white Philips bulbs</a>, which were dismantled and mounted to different heatsinks specifically for height clearances, and to run a bit cooler. It is also completely Arduino controlled and features automatic watering, <a href='https://github.com/MrSparkleCA/MrSparkle-ArduinoGrowController'>you can find the code here</a>. My goal was to have a Single 5gal Bucket with no risers and use passive intakes instead of forced like i see a lot of people doing, and also have pretty much everything contained in the one bucket. It consumes 26-28 Watts of energy, and for me cost around $40 to make."
