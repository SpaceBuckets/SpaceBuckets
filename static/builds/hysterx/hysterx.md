This is my second attempt at a bucket build.</strong> This new prototype was made using 'isiplast' buckets, they are meant to transport dangerous products, so they are much more sturdy than standard buckets. This will give me a great foundation to work on. For the moment I'm using <a href='https://amzn.to/3jMfTYw'>CFL bulbs</a> without side-lighting, but I will probably upgrade this configuration in the future. I'm still working on the ventilation. Thanks for looking, wish me luck!"
