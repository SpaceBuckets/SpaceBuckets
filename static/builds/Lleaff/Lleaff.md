c: "The idea of this space bucket was to be as stealthy as possible and <strong>modular so the height can be altered easily</strong>. I have Dual output surge protector plugged into a standard power plug to IEC adaptor. A timer and a 12VDC 1.5 amp power supply for the fans. The black part above it is a light trap made of cardboard covered in gaffer tape. The bottom of the plant area with a pot tray to allow the fan to blow air from under the plant up into the bucket."
