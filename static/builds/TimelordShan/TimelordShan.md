c: "Hello everyone! This is my bucket. <strong>It is a super basic build.</strong> To avoid doing any electrical work at all, I bought fans with plugs and screw on attachments for my bulbs with plugs on the end. It all plugs into a power adapter on the side. My light top is four bulbs; two y sockets on opposite ends and a fan in the middle. <strong>Thanks for watching, wish me luck!</strong>"
