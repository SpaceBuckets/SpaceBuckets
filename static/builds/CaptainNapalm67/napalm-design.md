c: "Hi everyone! The main inspiration for the design is to <strong>cut down on the amount of buckets used.</strong> Spacers can be wasteful since the <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HP0NFBE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00HP0NFBE&linkCode=as2&tag=spacbuck-20&linkId=XS5FKC6OQL2HPUCJ'>180W UFO</a> needs a set distance regardless to avoid bleaching. The <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BPIWY28/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BPIWY28&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=spacbuck-20'>7020 LED</a> side lighting is powered by a 12V 10A converter. The exhaust fan is a 4' is tied at the end of a 4' dryer duct I bought from a local hardware store.
Wedging the upside-down bucket into a spacer is actually very sturdy. It takes very little effort to make it very difficult to pull apart. As a result, it feels like it's one seamless piece attached to a spacer. <strong>This let's you save about 2-3 spacers by creating a top piece. </strong>I attached the UFO to the upside-down bucket with only zip-ties. Temperatures are in the low 80s."
