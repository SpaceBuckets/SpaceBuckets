Total cost was around $150-180. Used potting soil with 30% perlite and dolomite plus bloodmeal. The light my <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>UFO LED</a> was giving out illuminated my room too much so I picked up a <strong>fan dust cover</strong>. I reused an old fan I had in my old PC case which has a <strong>fan speed controller</strong> on it for keeping down the noise."
