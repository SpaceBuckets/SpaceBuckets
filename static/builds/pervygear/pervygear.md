c: "This is my first bucket! Still a few touches needed to finish it (I'm missing a carbon filter for the moment). I decided to go with a 220L drum as my main container. Intake is a 140mm fan, I also use a 150mm for extraction. <strong>I have a <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>UFO LED light</a> and a 5050SMD strip for side-lighting.</strong> Wish me luck!"
