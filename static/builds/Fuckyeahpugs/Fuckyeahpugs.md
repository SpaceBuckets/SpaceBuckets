c: "This is my first ever build! Criticism is welcome. I wanted more room so I went with a supersized Space Bucket. <strong>I am using a 180w Apollo LED light, two strips of 5630SMD LEDs and USB fans for ventilation</strong> (hopefully they provide powerful airflow). There is so much light! The plants will love it. If I wasn't so proud of the chiefs I wouldn't think twice about black duct taping it all."
