c: "Just found out Space Buckets a few weeks ago and <strong>I really loved the concept so I decided to build one</strong> taking ideas from different posts. I'm in the phase now of testing temperature and humidity, photoperiod cycles, and the irrigation system. <strong>Everything is working as expected!</strong>
  The bucket has 4 intake openings for airflow, transmitter for temperature and humidity, irrigation system using PVC pipes and also a 7L airpot.The pot is inside a cut out bottom of a bucket about 2 inches tall to catch any runoff water. The plan is to leave it there to keep the humidity about 50-70% inside the bucket. If it goes higher then that water can be drained very easily.
  <h3>PLANT FOOD</h3>
  Regarding nutrients. I bought <a href='http://amzn.to/1Lk0Ik5'>FoxFarm nutes</a> that I'm planning to use depending on the stage I'm in (vegetative vs flowering). With these nutrients you prepare the mix with water and then you irrigate. You need to control the pH before adding any nutrients (it should be between 6.5 and 6.8) and once they are added you have to control the EC (electrical conductivity), this one depends on the stage (it should be around 0.9 during the vegetative stage and between 1.5 and 2.0 during flowering). You don't add any nutrients during the germination and seedling stages and during these stages the pH should be between 6.5 and 6.8 and the EC should be around 0.4.
  <h3>WATERING STUFF</h3><strong>The irrigation system is very simple</strong>, it uses PVC pipes to go from the outside into the inside of the bucket and it contains a valve that can be used to control the flow of the water. So, I pour the water into the bottle, it goes down the hose, and it's then evenly dispersed by the PVC pipes, these PVC pipes have holes in them  and it goes around the stem of the plant to get water everywhere. <strong>I just wanted to look as clean as possible, and I'm happy with the results.</strong> I'm sure I'll have to do adjustments during the next months but nothing major I hope."
