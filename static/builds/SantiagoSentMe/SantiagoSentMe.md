c: "I have finished my Space Bucket! <strong>It has been a great day.</strong> Any comments, questions or constructive criticism about my build are welcome.<h3>BUCKET DESIGN</h3>I went with a classic SB. <strong>I'm using standard 5gal white buckets</strong> blacked out with Gorilla Tape. For lighting I have a 42w bulb in the center, and two Y-a adapters with<strong> 42w and 23w CFLs</strong>. This adds up to about 11,600 lumens total. Used 2 bucket tops so that all lights are approximately on the same level. Also using a roll of 5630SMD LED strips. The light-top ventilation features a 120mm Axial Fan with 110cfm.<h3>OTHER STUFF</h3>I'm testing an airflow configuration with 4 intakes. <strong>Used PVC elbows to block all the light coming of out the bucket. </strong>I have mounted a fan speed controller and 12v 5A power supply for LED strip to the side. Tubes and valves came from a local home store similar to Lowes or Home Depot (it's half inch tubing). I built a runoff tray mounted a hose with valve for easy emptying. For this I'm using inch and a half screws installed about 2 inches apart. Also I wanted to be able to water without taking off the top every time. Trying out a watering system using a cheap squirt bottle with bottom cut out, a simple valve, and a hose with a ring of hose with small holes. Not sure how well this will work but I'm gonna try it.<h3>FUTURE ROADMAP</h3><strong>I'm going to try some different designs</strong> but might have to add a 2nd fan. Currently with 1 fan and no filter my bucket holds steady at 75-76°F while the temp in the room is 69-70°F. All I have left to do is my carbon scrubber. The first one I made was 'too good' and wouldn't let enough air through even with my 110cfm fan."
