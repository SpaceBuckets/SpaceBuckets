c: "This is my rig! I am using 2x50L totes, with the <strong><a href='https://www.amazon.com/MarsHydro-Spectrum-Hydroponic-Indoor-Growing/dp/B00XC3LBI2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=lawn-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1514860629&sr=1-1&keywords=mars+300&linkCode=ll1&tag=spacbuck-20&linkId=177221032c2248fa8f8b41b6f53b9214'>300w mars hydro UFO LED</a> as the main lighting</strong>. I used some zip ties to hold the LED. Quite a lot of light leak from the top but it shouldn't cause me any grief since this is in my store room that is kept dark most of the time.
For airflow I have two computer fans, and the inside of the buckets lined with silver insulation sheets. I've got my exit exhaust going with a PC fan connected to a power regulator <strong>so I can control the fan speed</strong>."
