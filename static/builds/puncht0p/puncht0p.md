c: "I finished my first space bucket this weekend, thanks for sharing all the great information. I had a difficult time understanding how the buckets stacked because my first buckets were from Walmart and theirs only add 1-inch when stacking (<strong>don't use those!</strong>). To help people in my shoes I decided to create a <a href='http://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceBuckets/comments/1l0nqn/first_build_album_cost_for_two_buckets/'>detailed post with the pricing</a> I found and some detailed photos that demonstrate the stacking. To finish my first bucket off I need to seal the light moguls with plumbers putty. I also plan on building a DIY-carbon filter to cover the top fan. Let me know if there is anything I should change when building bucket #2."
