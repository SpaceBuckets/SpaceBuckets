c: "My awesome husband built my setup as <strong>my Christmas present.</strong> I'm mainly using it to start carnivorous plants from seeds. Right now I have Venus flytrap seedlings and pygmy sundews from gemmae. I'm also really into American Pitcher Plants and will be starting those seeds in the bucket later this month. Most of my plants are temperate, so I move them outside after reaching maturity. Though I'd also like to use the bucket for tropical varieties that need more consistent temperature control. I'm using two strips of LEDs on the walls, but I will add more lights for top lighting. Check out <a href='http://www.thecarnivoregirl.com/space-bucket'><strong>my blog post</strong></a> with a few more pictures and details. Thanks for looking, bucketeers! :)"
