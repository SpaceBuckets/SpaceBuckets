c: "Thanks Space Buckets inspiring this build! It uses CFL bulbs and PC fans. I wanted to build something that I could keep in my room and have it be simple and sleek, so I built it in a way where all the wiring would run internally to one plug in the back. For all the wiring at the top, I used a bendable powerstrip because I needed something that could wrap around the camera. I have a camera on top to keep an eye on the temperature once I get a thermometer (and a plant)."
