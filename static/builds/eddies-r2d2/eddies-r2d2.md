c: "What is up boys! This is my first Space Bucket! I have a different design than most because <strong>I used a lamp screen to make the light-top</strong> (it is very reflective so I save some time there). The lamp fits the bucket perfectly! I'm using <a href='https://amzn.to/3jMfTYw'>CFL bulbs</a> and 3 meters of LED strips. I want to thank <a href='/u/ekrof'>ekrof</a> for taking the time with the website and all of you for this cool community. <strong>I have never grown before but discovering these made it possible for me!</strong>"
