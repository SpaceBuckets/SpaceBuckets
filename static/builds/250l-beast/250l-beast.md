c: "This is my build of a 250L container into a space bucket. Still tweaking to perfect everything and try to automate most things eventually. I used a mix of reflective 'greenhouse garden reflective silver foil', aluminium tape and a bit of aluminium foil to fully cover the interior with reflective material. The foil was stuck on with spray on glue and the aluminum tape. A 5m LED full spectrum light is wrapper nearer the bottom of the barrel, hopefully penetrate through the canopy and increase bottom yield. The top LED light is a Phlizon 600W light, I also have a light at the bottom of the barrel at the moment, some LED white light on a lamp which I may keep but relocate in the future. I am growing auto Gorilla Shizzle by ShortStuff seeds and Acapulco Gold regular seeds, which will be moved outdoors once frost is gone."
