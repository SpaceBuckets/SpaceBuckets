c: "I present my Space Shuttle! I am using non standard trash cans that are working pretty well. Betting on cheap CFL bulbs for the moment. <strong>The PC fans are wired all into a 12v transformer</strong>, connects the strip light and the ventilation all in one, though I have a switch mechanism to turn the LED on and off."
