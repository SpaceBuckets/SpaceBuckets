The main lighting is a <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Apollo-Horticulture-GL60LED-Spectrum-Growing/dp/B00FGFW0XO//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=spacbuck-20&linkId=fc532131671012b3fd6b4f9200090b7e'>180w UFO LED light</a>, which should work well for my 5gal containers. I'm also using a <a href='https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Y27FJ1C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=spacbuck-20&linkId=3a5d3e435ed4299c9b6c19d4a0f02f28'>small heating pad</a> to keep heat at roots during the cold nights, it is controlled by temperature. I'm also trying a custom carbon air outtake filter: bought some pen holders and wrapped them with carbon filter material; I then glued the inner piece to a hold I had cut on the plant bucket. <strong>Thanks for looking and for being such a great community!</strong>"
