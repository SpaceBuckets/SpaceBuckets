c: "How is this for my first space bucket? Whipped it up yesterday! Next step is to wrap some black tape all around to prevent light leakage, followed by <strong>a simple irrigation system</strong>. For the main lighting configuration <strong>I'm using 4x24w CFL bulbs</strong>, with 2-4 more in planning to add later."
