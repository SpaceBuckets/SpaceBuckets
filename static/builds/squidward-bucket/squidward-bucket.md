c: "Finally finished my bucket, complete with <strong>3D printed mountings</strong> for fans, a <strong><a href='http://amzn.to/2ncfxRD'>UFO LED light</a></strong>, and various electronics. I'm a bit iffy about the plant part of the equation, as I've always had a bit of a black thumb, so I decided to make the bucket as best as I can. One of my longstanding hobbies has been 3D printing so I made mounting brackets for all the components to make things tidier and easier to replace if anything breaks. Looking like squidward was mostly a happy coincidence, though once the electronics backpack 'nose' was on I knew I was in the market for some teal spray paint. For those of you that already have a 3d printer <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwpdvOL8qw2GclcxcUs3LUZ1NE0/view'>here are the files</a>."
