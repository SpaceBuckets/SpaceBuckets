c: "What up guys! This is my second bucket and things are looking good. I am using a 'new' bucket for this grow. Set-up goes something like this: 2.5 gal Hempy bucket, closed, inside a 5 gal bucket with SCROG chicken wire. 1/2 perlite and vermiculite at the bottom (hempy mix), 1/2 hempymix and soilmix on top. Hole drilled a third of the way up.
Mounted inside a 5 gal bucket with aluminum tape for reflection.  Mounted on top is a 300W light base with socket mods. I use CFL bulbs and a LED floodlight, alongisde a LED strip on the walls. For airflow I have a 6' metal desk fan."
