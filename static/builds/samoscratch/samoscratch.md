c: "Hello Bucketeers! Some time ago the mighty Ekrof asked me to post some pics of my bucket, and<strong> now I finally got around to modifying it!</strong> I installed more powerful fans, they move a lot of air. I also moved them up so I could have a little more room for a pot instead of planting directly into the bucket. <strong>I've also attached a UFO LED full spectrum</strong> light just for kicks and a nice exhaust for it. I reversed the fans of the UFO for extra exhaust as well."
