c: "Hey Guys! Christmas comes early. I finished my first 'Space Tote' today. I used 2 totes I had around the house. The basic design is to use the bottom tote for the DWC hydro and the top tote for the lighting. I modified the bottom tote so that the hydro only went about 2/3 of the way up the tote to leave more vertical room for growing. I used a 12v/200mA power dapter to run the fans, a 12v/4.2A laptop charger that powered all the LED strips (pulled about 45w from the wall). <strong>The bulbs are temporary just to show the idea, use <a href='https://amzn.to/3jMfTYw'>CFL bulbs</a> or LED!</strong>"
