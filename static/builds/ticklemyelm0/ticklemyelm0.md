First of all, I really appreciate the crazy wealth of information this community has, as well as the s<strong>uper helpful and awesome people that are a part of it</strong>. I watched you guys for a year before I finally got the go-ahead to finally do this. And a special thanks to <a href='/u/ekrof'>/u/Ekrof</a> for helping out and making this whole subreddit even exist.

<h3>GENERAL ADVICE</h3>
Visit the <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceBuckets/comments/461u0m/finally_roughly_finished_presenting_elmos_bucket/'>subreddit thread</a> for a full part list. Total cost was about ~0. Honestly, you can keep costs way lower than mine, I was just going for gold, and had the money to spare. I figure I'll be able to recoup the losses in around 6 to 8 months anyway.
For the soil, if you get the Fox Farm, <strong>it's cheaper at a local Hydroponics shop</strong>. For the pH control kit and the nutrients, chances are Amazon is cheaper(the places I checked were all more expensive for those products). <strong>A Dremel or box cutter</strong> are absolutely necessary for this. I personally didn't use the dremel I got for this very much because it was too loud, box cutters work well as a substitute, but be prepared to be very careful and have a very tired hand.
I also bought <strong>Activated Carbon</strong> for a future carbon filter, still deciding what kind of design I want to go with though, that will probably be a future update."
