The fan you see is <strong><a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0053Y2Y6Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0053Y2Y6Q&linkCode=as2&tag=spacbuck-20&linkId=Q3KM4EYJKC77ZNFJ'>a 115v evaporator fan motor</a></strong> from a high-end fridge... it is much, much stronger than any pc fan. I am using the LimoStudio 4-socket adapter, and I built a vent cover (cardboard and duct tape) for the fan, helping to ensure that air flows from within.The spacer has 2.5m of 5630 Warm White LEDs. The Main Bucket has 2.5m of 5050 Cool White LEDs. I added male/female insulated disconnect terminals for ease of add/remove. All of the wiring has been dressed and attached to the bucket, so only one cord is coming away."
