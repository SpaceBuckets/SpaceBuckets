c: "Here is my build! <strong>The light lid is comprised of a <a style='color: #136baf' href='http://amzn.to/21jnEWN'><strong>200w LED COB light</strong></a></strong> and a 120mm computer fan; the bottom of the lid is completely covered in aluminum tape, creating a reflector for the light. Inside of the bucket is painted entirely flat white, outside is flat black. 

For ventilation I installed <strong>80mm intake fans on the walls of the bucket</strong>. The fans are connected to a 4-way speed controller allowing for complete control of air flow as well as adjusting humidity levels. I attached the power strip and fan speed controller to the bucket using adhesive Velcro. This makes deconstructing the bucket simple if parts need to be replaced. I have fan screen covers on the intake fans. I'm planning on buying a 120mm cover and also creating light traps to keep outside ambient light from getting inside. Trying to maintain as much of a <strong>controlled environment </strong>as possible. Thanks for looking!"
