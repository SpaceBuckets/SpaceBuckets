c: "This is my ridiculously tall budget bucket! For airflow I am using three 60mm Intake fans, and an 120mm exhaust fan that pulls air through 4 2.5' of pipes filled with activated carbon. I am testing a lighting configuration with four 11w <a href='https://amzn.to/3lyKIRa'>LED bulbs</a> and one 23w CFL, alongisde 6 LED strips down the sides. I think I've spent around $80 including soil and nutrients."
