c: "My garden is painted and ready to launch! For this build I used a supersized container, a Bin of 44x60cm. I painted the inside walls with a black spray to keep the light from escaping. For the main lighting I am using four 12w <a href='https://amzn.to/3lyKIRa'>LED bulbs</a> with the covers removed. I have a fixture that I can raise or lower according to the plant needs."
