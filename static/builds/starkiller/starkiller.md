c: "I'm using 4 buckets, mylar, spray paint, duct tape, 2 PCfans, zip ties, and a 65w CFL bulb. I set the fans to high on the exhaust, and med to the intake.<strong> I shall call it, STARKILLER!</strong><strong>For the filter I used PVC plumbing pipe</strong>, drilled holes with a screwdriver and 1 screw. Fitted 2 PC fans inside pvc (3in). Used sealant to lock the fans In place. Rewired fans to one usb chord. I already have an exhaust fan inside the bucket lid, so all together a total of 3 fans. Used drywall patch tape as a screen inside to keep carbon from falling through."
