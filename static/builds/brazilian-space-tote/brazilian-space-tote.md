  I've heard about space buckets a white ago, but since I've decided to try to grow indoor medicine my interest sparkled and coincidence or not, HighTimes Magazine publishes an article on how to build your own space bucket on December 2017 presenting some of its history and a few designs. What caught my attention was the DYI philosophy and the 'quasi-anarquist' attitude to make it work independently of space, structure, costs and labour.
  When I saw the next article from HighTimes in January 2018 it was it, this article presented 6 sickest space bucket designs and The Space Tote V3 by /u/spacetotebuilder completely caught me thinking, this one is the one I want to build and try.
  So I've decided to give this build a chance, so my own design is inspired by Space Tote V3.
  I've started buying the LED panel, 5m of LED Strip, mylar film and the humidity and temperature monitor from Amazon. Next step I've made a visit to local electronics super cheap market in my town to find the rest of the materials, such as 4 computer fans, electric outlet, 2 x 12V 5A power adapters, one for the LED Strip and the other for the computer fans (the fans keep on 24/7) and the LED strip follows the light schedule and the timer for the lights. Another visit to local hardware store and bought 2 hinges, screws and 2 rectangular trash cans to use as totes to create my grow environment.

  The 2 bottom fans intake air to the environment and the top 2 fans exhaust it. I've chosen this not so wide trash cans for it's height and cheap price. Proper totes are expensive in our country. Maybe I'll upgrade to bigger totes as soon as I find some 90+liters sturdy totes for a cheap price. Right now only found it expensive ones.

  My first seedling test is already growing fast and its good. If I notice dust being pulled inside, I'll add a light and thin net screen to intake fans to help avoid dust.

  I hope this could inspire another bucketeer to build and have great harvest and change this world little by little to a better place. Jah Bless! "
