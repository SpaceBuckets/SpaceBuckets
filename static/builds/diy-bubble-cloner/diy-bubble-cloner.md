c: "This is my simple cloning project. The tiny pots are made of peat and the <a href='http://amzn.to/2mKwBNO'>rooters are spongy</a> and get moistened. The bucket isn't filled with water to the brim, <strong>the point is to keep the rooter moist into the peat pot. </strong>I'm going to dremel two small holes near the lid on the side of the bucket to run <a href='http://amzn.to/2mpl05F'>the tubing</a> in and then electrical tape around there to tape them down and further block light from the roots. If the bucket is not fully opaque I'll just tape it up as well.
  <h3>SYSTEM BENEFITS</h3><strong>Oxygenation occurs with <a href='http://amzn.to/2m3mnnd'>the bubbling</a> and promotes the healthy root growth while the actual pod should just require an initial moistening. </strong>As <a href='http://amzn.to/2lHm3zb'>the roots grow</a> from the cutting they will search out the water below. I will fashion a dome to go over it that will increase humidity and prevent it from drying out too quickly."
