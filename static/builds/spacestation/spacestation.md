c: "This is my <strong>inline-filtered Space Station!</strong> For now all bins have 6x15w LED bulbs + 5630 LED strips for lighting. The air scrubbing works great, and no smells are present. I've used some ducting to connect everything together and I hope that the setup will be able handle six bins or more in the future. An unexpected feature is being about to use it to filter smoke from the air. <strong>This is too much fun, I think I'm breaking new ground here </strong>(so there is lots of trial and error)."
