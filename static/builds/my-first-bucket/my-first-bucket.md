I've been (for the most part) following u/mcscroggins' <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceBuckets/comments/1t590b/complete_build_guide_for_a_blackout_space_bucket/'>Blackout  Space Bucket guide</a>, which has been incredibly helpful, but I do have one question: In using the <a href='https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FGFW0XO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s02?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1'>Apollo LED grow light</a>, which has an exhaust fan on the back, do I still want to use two PC fans, or is that a sufficient exhaust? I've added a second PC fan just under the light as an exhaust which has helped lower temperatures, and added a small dish of water as a temporary means of raising humidity, as well as adding 2 more spacers to give it additional height. Thanks again to everyone who's contributed to r/spacebuckets, you've helped immensely."
