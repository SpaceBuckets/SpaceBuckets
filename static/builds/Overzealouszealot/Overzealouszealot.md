c: "This is my hydro DWC Space Tote! It is 90% done.<strong> I'm using stacked 30gal totes, a 300W MarsHydro LED light (138 true wattage)</strong>, 4x23w CFLs, and a 120mm exhaust fan. Used weather sealer to avoid light leaks between totes and from LED. Need to touch up tape on lid, add an intake, and get side LED strips. Grow wise it's two DWC systems both with CANNA Flora Vega A+B and CANNA Ryzotonik. Thanks for all your continued help!"
