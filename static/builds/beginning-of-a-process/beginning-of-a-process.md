c: "So I'm running a passive intake build which takes a lot of influence for this build. Big shout out to /u/ticklemyelm0! <strong>I basically used his post as my main foundation.</strong> Now with that said the materials are four 5 gallon buckets from Home Depot, a <a href='http://amzn.to/21jnEWN'>180w UFO LED light</a> (and <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BPIWY28/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BPIWY28&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=spacbuck-20'>5050SMD side-lighting</a>), plus a 240 CFM duct fan. Since I was running passive I wanted something powerful enough to pull through the UFO and push through the carbon filter once I get it. I have a 6' to 8' duct attachment that fits perfectly over the UFO exaust holes which means I dont have to make any custom card board work on top.The only things I have left to do on this build is tape down the the exhaust. A<strong>nd also create the electrical box attachment </strong>which allows me to hide the wires neatly. Total cost for the build is probably around $350 once I get the carbon filter as it stands now its sitting around $250 or so. Majority of the cost has been the UFO and exhaust fan. I live in a luxury Apartment so it is imperative that I hide the smell this is why I went for an exhaust that I can easily add the carbon filter if it gets too stinky, which I fully expect it will. <strong>I really like the look of it so I leave it in my living room and its not an eyesore.</strong>"
