c: "Here is my bucket! It is a little rough around the edges but stealth or looks are not a concern of mine. Tools used were a box opener and duct tape. <strong>The lighting configuration features an Apollo <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>UFO LED light</a> 180w</strong>, and for airflow I have two line-voltage fans I got off Amazon."
