c: "1st bucket I've done. It's been tested and It's ready for plantation. Altho it's still a work in progress as I need to figure out how I'm going to set it up with a active or passive carbon filter. Escaping aroma is not an option for me unfortunately, hence why I am waiting until May/June to plant, incase I need to bring out doors.&nbsp;"
