c: "I made a system where i can adjust the height of my lights. Works like a charm. For you cfl grower's out there, i advise you to do this if you are not going to work with stackable buckets.
I found my buckets (43 liters) in a local gardening shop. They are pretty great, also I used a psu from an old computer i had lying around to power the LEDs, and PC fans. 
The orange thread supports the hanging structure which relieves strain on the wiring to prevent any failure."
