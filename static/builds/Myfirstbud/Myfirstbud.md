c: "This is my first build and grow! It is a classic bucket with four <a href='https://amzn.to/3jMfTYw'>CFL bulbs</a> and some PC fans. Fantasmo express was not my first choice for a bucket grow. But after killing a few seedlings early on of what I wanted to grow( sour crinkle) I switched seeds and this one took off after I fixed watering and PH issues. Special thanks to those in the <strong><a href='https://discord.gg/TZC2tAv'>Space Buckets discord chat</a></strong> that have helped me along the way!"
