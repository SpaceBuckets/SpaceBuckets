c: "For my builds I join <a href='http://imgur.com/6LqN6xS'>5-gallon bucket bottoms</a> together using the mouth of a 2-gallon bucket. You can use them as platforms for additional features. My <a href='http://imgur.com/uLVuMxk'>hanging pot holder</a> is another example of this. Always consider ways to extend simple materials.

<strong>First start with the LST net rough cut.</strong> Drill the holes before you cut anything. Cut along the rim before you cut out the tabs. For the finished LST net, one length of twine pulled tight keeps it simple to build. You should fit the lid on a 2 gallon bucket as you weave the net. This keeps tension from distorting the rim. Wrap excess string around the last tab and secure it with white duct tape. <strong>I love that it looks like a very simple dream catcher!</strong>"
