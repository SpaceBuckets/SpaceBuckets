c: "<strong>I had a lot of fun with the build</strong>, and made a last minute decision to add a fan on/off switch for fun. In retrospect, I wish I did separate intake/outtake fan switches because more LED indicator lights means more fun! But, oh well, there's always next time. The temps are a little high at the moment, <strong>but I'm sure I'll figure it out and you'll hear from me during the growing!</strong>"
