c: "Hey guys! I've only grown once before so this is fairly new to me, but reading up on my <strong>Space Bucket literature has got me so hooked. </strong>I absolutely love this thing and cannot stop staring at it! I have to give credit to <a href='http://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceBuckets/comments/1t590b/complete_build_guide_for_a_blackout_space_bucket/'>/u/mcscroggins</a> for the inspiration. Currently running 23w CFLs x4 5000k and 1 2700k 24 hrs until I see something. <strong>I'm really happy to finally join the squad!</strong></strong>"
