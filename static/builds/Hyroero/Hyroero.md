c: "Got a <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>UFO LED light</a> <strong>powered at ~135w</strong>. I swapped the fans around so the UFO would become the exhaust for my bucket. Be careful, no idea if this is safe! <strong>Testing it right now.</strong> Also salvaged a fan from an old PC and spliced the wires with a 12v 1A power supply. Drilled holes in the bottom of the bucket for drainage. <strong>Covered it all in tape which was really satisfying."
