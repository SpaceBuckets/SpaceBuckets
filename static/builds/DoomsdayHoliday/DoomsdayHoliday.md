c: "This is my finished stealth <strong>Space bucket: Shadow Trooper</strong>. The box on top cover the  three passive <strong><a href='http://amzn.to/2pKqoAm'><strong>20w LED bulbs</strong></a></strong>. Simple cardboard fully taped inside and outside, layed out with tinfoil and sealed properly. I can open those two box clips comfortably from above and below to have a lookc or access the plant for watering. I build <strong>a small light trap</strong> with an opening at the bootom for the passive air intake, which is only big as a golf ball. The 80mm fan on the back works perfectly fine. The fan controller is hidden at the side, so I can regulate the airflow, smell and sound for stealth. Covered the intake fan with a thin silk sock cutout (black) to catch dust."
