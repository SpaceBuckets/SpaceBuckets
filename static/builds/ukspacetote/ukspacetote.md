Glad to have found the <a href='http://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceBuckets'>/r/SpaceBuckets community</a> for inspiration and advice. Here is what I did with my newly learned skills. In the lid of the top tote I added a 7-in-1 light fixture. I will be using a combination of LED.
Being a bit of an electronics nerd <strong>I decided to automate my spacetote</strong>. I am using a RaspberryPi with some sensors, relays and a webcam. I am using a DHT22 sensor to measure temperature and humidity, a BH1750 to measure light levels, and a 4 channel relay module to control my lights and water pumps. Sensor information is pushed to the AdafruitIO cloud so I have nice graphs of my growing conditions. I use cron jobs and python scripts to control the timing of the relays for lights and watering. The webcam is managed using the MotionEye package. This allows easy live viewing of the camera and simple time-lapse creation."
