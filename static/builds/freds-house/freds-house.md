c: "We started this bucket for an outdoor seedling that we wanted to bring indoors for a longer veg time since it’s almost Fall here.

We used two 27 gallon black totes. To make them reflective, we spray painted first with a coat of Kilz to cover the inside of the totes followed by some chrome metallic. It seems to work well so far. We used the Roledro 300w UFO LED light cut in the top, and have since added two sets of LEDMO LED strip lights (3000k) around the top of the bottom bin for better all around lighting. We have two Silenx fans for input and exhaust. They seem to work well, although in retrospect, we should have had the bulk of the fan outside of the bucket. This set comes with a transformer with a speed knob to adjust the fan speed as needed with 5 total plug ins for additional fans.

We haven’t light proofed it, but will have an external case for the whole setup when bloom comes (e.g., a light proofed cardboard box case that we can just cover the whole thing unless we need in). Seems easier than fighting leaks.

We cut a hole in the side of the top bin and secured it with Velcro so we can peek without taking the whole top off. We’ve also moved the plants way closer to the light for the time being.

We are still early in the cycle, but it seems to be working out well for a first attempt."
