c: "<strong>Here is my submission for joining the Space Bucket ranks.</strong> I live in a very small apartment and the only space I have to grow is the space on top of my fridge. So after some planning I put together this build: it consists of two 32gal trashcans lined with a thick aluminum insulation and wrapped with 5 meters of SMD5630 LED lights. 

<strong>Under the hood is a custom COB </strong> LED I built with two VERO 29 (gen.7) powered by a Meanwell 1400b. I think I'll have to add another exhaust fan because it still gets warm inside with the lights on full. The CFL is just temporary."
