So after some planning I put together this build: it consists of two 32gal trashcans lined with a thick aluminum insulation and wrapped with 5 meters of <a href='https://amzn.to/30TZOZn'>5630SMD LED strips</a>. 

    <strong>Under the hood is a custom COB </strong> LED I built with two VERO 29 (gen.7) powered by a Meanwell 1400b. I think I'll have to add another exhaust fan because it still gets warm inside with the lights on full. The <a href='https://amzn.to/3jMfTYw'>CFL bulb</a> is just temporary."
