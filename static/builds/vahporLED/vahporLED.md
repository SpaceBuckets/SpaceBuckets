c: "I learned that lowering my intake fan speed helped lower temps further. The exhaust fan needs to <strong>create a vacuum</strong> to get it to perform properly. I adjusted my LED strip and fastened it with zip ties. Lowered a wrap of strip for better under canopy and small plant/veg/clone growth.I rigged up my <a href='http://amzn.to/2n7BVLp'>cool mist humidifier</a> to move the mist towards the intake fan ducting. <strong>It worked really well to bring humidity up and temps down very quickly.</strong> I am however concerned about the mist going through the fan. <strong>Still testing this!</strong>"
