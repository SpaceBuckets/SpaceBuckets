CFLs and LEDs have made it all possible. I plan to do a more traditional bucket build in the near future. A Space Bucket can be whatever you want it to be. The fun part is the DIY aspect, experimenting and innovating, finding out what works and what doesn't, learning from others, reading tons... It's a great hobby. <strong>These things are addictive. Hope you enjoy the build!</strong>"
