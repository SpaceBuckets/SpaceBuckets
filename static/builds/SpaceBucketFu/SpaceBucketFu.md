c: "This is my hydroponic tote project! I decided to build my own LED light, I will be posting a complete guide shortly. I'm a Citizen clu048-1212 COB LED at 50w (660,630,430nm), monochromatics LEDs at 18w and a 530nm green LED at 30w. Studies have shown at high lighting levels green light can be more efficient than both red and blue at driving photosynthesis. The white cobs I chose for their high levels of green light. The mono green LED supplements that.
  <strong>At this moment I'm growing strawberries and hot peppers.</strong> I think the Jalepeno will do great. The roots are already growing slightly into the reservoir which is great. Wish me luck!"
