c: "<strong>This is my veggie build!</strong> Decided to go for a barrel rather than a bucket because I haven't got the tools to cut open lots of buckets. I went for a <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>UFO LED light</a> on top with <a href='https://www.amazon.com/LEDMO-16-4Ft-300LEDs-Non-waterproof-brightness/dp/B01339F06I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=spacbuck-20&linkId=fd1286fa215eed0cc5b97f5689b28f46'>5630SMD strip LEDs</a> on the inside. I wrapped the barrel in black tape as well at a later date, partly because it might reduce light loss, <strong>but also because it looks cool!</strong> Also only got one exhaust fan with three square passive intakes (holes) cut near the bottom, which should provide enough cooling. The <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>UFO LED light</a> has it's own cooling fans, and is outside the bucket itself, so only the inside LEDs need cooling."
