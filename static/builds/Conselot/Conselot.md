c: "<strong>This is my veggie build!</strong> Decided to go for a barrel rather than a bucket because I haven't got the tools to cut open lots of buckets. I went for a <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Apollo-Horticulture-GL60LED-Spectrum-Growing/dp/B00FGFW0XO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=spacbuck-20&linkId=b96e97eef71e49ba09a1503040e59352'>UFO LED</a> on top with <a href='https://www.amazon.com/LEDMO-16-4Ft-300LEDs-Non-waterproof-brightness/dp/B01339F06I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=spacbuck-20&linkId=fd1286fa215eed0cc5b97f5689b28f46'>5630SMD strip LEDs</a> on the inside. I wrapped the barrel in black tape as well at a later date, partly because it might reduce light loss, <strong>but also because it looks cool!</strong> Also only got one exhaust fan with three square passive intakes (holes) cut near the bottom, which should provide enough cooling. The UFO has it's own cooling fans, and is outside the bucket itself, so only the inside LEDs need cooling."
