c: "Hello bucketeers! Thank you Commander Ekrof for inventing the Space Bucket and for creating <strong>the friendliest gardening site in the galaxy</strong>. And thank everyone in the community for all the fun I had building my buckets.<h3>BUCKET PLANNING</h3>I started small with materials I had at home: a 12 liters bucket, with bottom removed (which fitted exactly on the inner rim of a 5 liters pot), another 12 liters bucket (just slightly wider than the first one), which made a nice spacer. Holes in the lid, <a href='http://amzn.to/1YlxtRS'>3x20w warm white LED bulbs</a>, 5 meters of <a href='http://amzn.to/1S9nZup'>5050SMD LEDs</a>, PVC elbows for light traos, and a small PC fan (6cm). First try yielded 35g, no topping no LST (Syrup Autoflower). <strong>I rapidly exhausted my stock of buckets by building two more</strong>, and then I started on a new project.<h3>TOWER PLANNING</h3>After two weeks of brainstorming, hours lurking in the DIY shop (comparing air ducts, water ducts, power strips), <strong>I came up with The Dark Tower</strong>: it isn't a bucket, nor a brute, however this qualifies as a 'small container' and is 100% relevant to the <a href='/manifesto'>Bucket Philosophy</a>.
I used stackable boxes (36x26cm 22cm height), with flat inner sides. Lined the inside with Mylar and <a href='http://amzn.to/1S9o4hS'>5630SMD LEDs</a>. The lower box has two 10cm passive intake with PVC elbows. The second box has a 10cm watering hole, very useful as I don't have to take out the plant (or rather take away the boxes) every time I water. The top box contains one <a href='http://amzn.to/1YlxKnV'>UFO light (85w)</a>, one home made carbon filter (recycling a silencer for air ducts), and a line extractor. Later I added 2x20w LED bulbs."
