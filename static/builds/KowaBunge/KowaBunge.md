c: "<strong>This is my first build!</strong> I used four 5gal buckets and one lid, so one bucket with 2 spacers and a third spacer with lid attached as my light set up. Installed a 8x8 PC fan on the side but am replacing it as I want more airflow. For lighting I installed <strong>two 2 prong light socket adapters</strong> to the sides of my top spacer/lid, also a 8x8 fan on top to pull heat. <a href='http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=90w%20ufo&linkCode=ur2&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3A90w%20ufo&tag=spacbuck-20&url=search-alias%3Daps&linkId=RYWDRTMP7IC43GZP'>I'm using 23W CFL</a> but only 2 bulbs for now to keep the temp down. I plan on adding LED strip but haven't purchased one yet."
