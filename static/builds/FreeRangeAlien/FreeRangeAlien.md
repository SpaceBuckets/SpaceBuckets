I've been watching all you guys and was nervous about building my own bucket <strong>but finally decided to get after it</strong>. And I'm glad I did! This is going to be a fun fall project for me. I use a <a href='https://www.amazon.com/LEDMO-Flexible-Waterproof-300LEDs-Daylight/dp/B01FFWQEPW//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=spacbuck-20&linkId=e5151fd75614be5e2b866cf1c9f7327c'>Roleadro 138w UFO LED</a> for the main lighting, and 5630SMD strips on the walls of the bucket. The light is brighter than I expected which is a good sign. It lights up my living room at night."
