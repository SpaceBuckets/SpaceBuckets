c: "<strong>This is my quick and dirty bucket!</strong> Was given a mostly-dead poinsettia to care for while my buddy is on his honeymoon. It has some fresh leaves on it after a couple days of watering so I whipped up a quick bucket rig using some stuff I had sitting around the shop. $12 CDN worth of material not including the LED (which was waiting for my new hydro rig). <strong>Hopefully I can get it growing!</strong>"
