c: "<strong>This tote is ~2.5 sq ft of space with a ~2 ft vertical limit.</strong> I'm using a 3g smart pot, with living-organic no-till soil. The grow chamber is a 18g roughneck tote, and the light top is made with a 10gal tote. I also have 80 and 120mm 12v fans to take care of the airflow.

    <strong>The custom LED fixture has four <a href='https://www.bridgelux.com/products/vero-series'>Vero 18 chips</a></strong> (two 5000k and two 3500k) and a 150w diver, 107-215vdc constant current (model HLG-120H-C700B). The LEDs are wired in series. With my current driver, capable of ~20.1 watts per chip/~80.4 watts total. ~43% efficiency (@ 700ma). I run them dimmed down quite a bit to keep temps in check, likely closer to 50w.

    In the future I'd like to automate some of the cooling and lighting with a controller and some more thermal probes."
