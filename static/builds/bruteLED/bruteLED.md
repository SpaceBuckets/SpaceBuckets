I used <a href='http://amzn.to/2loCTmk'>10gal brute buckets</a>, with a high power LEDat a cost of <strong>a little under $150</strong>. The buckets cost $50 and the light components were about another $50, all from Amazon. These brutes had the best $/height ratio when I built this and I chose white for the reflectivity, also lined them with Mylar foil using a glue stick. They have a volume of very approx. 3.5 cubic ft. For the light, I bought a <a href='http://amzn.to/2mCCe0Q'>100w warm-white COB LED</a>, a CPU cooler, a <a href='http://amzn.to/2lotiM9'>Meanwell 100w 12v DC power supply</a>, and <a href='http://amzn.to/2mojLEL'>constant current boost converter</a>. <strong>Threw those together without soldering</strong>, and had a minor hiccup when it didnâ€™t turn on before I adjusted the voltage on the converter. <strong>Many thanks to the community</strong> and bucketeers that helped me! <a href='http://imgur.com/a/Xt3vI'>Here is a flower album</a>."
