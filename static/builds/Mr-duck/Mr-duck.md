c: "This is my first bucket build! I'm using a UFO light with the internal fan reversed, and also 5050SMD LED strips for the walls of the garden. My medium is a mix of coco coir and perlite, with a layer of rocks on the bottom. <strong>I want to thank everyone who is a part of this amazing community</strong>, all your guides really helped a lot. Now onto the growing stage!"
