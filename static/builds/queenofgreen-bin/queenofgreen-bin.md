c: "This is a 110litre bin build using a '300watt' UFO LED mounted to the inside of the lid for the main light, and a 5050 LED strip for side lighting.
The inside of the bin is lined with Mylar using strong double sided sticky tape. 
There's a 120mm pc fan for intake, and a 4inch (diameter) inline fan, later on I will connect a carbon filter to the inline fan for smell control.
Everything is connected to a power supply mounted to the side of the bin to keep the growing area as tidy and clutter free as possible.
I used a lot of zip ties to hold everything in place, they are quick, easy to use and work surprisingly well.
There is some minor light leakage where I've drilled holes for the ties, but the bin itself is going to be kept in a dark cupboard so this isn't a huge concern for me. 
Eventually I want to trim the white fan connector on the lid so it's not hanging over the edge and also cover the yellow tape with something a bit less bright but these are purely cosmetic.

Here are links to some of the equipment I used:
