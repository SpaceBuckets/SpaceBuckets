And this is my first bucket garden build. <strong>I got inspired by all the great designs on this community</strong>, basically followed <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceBuckets/comments/2iztsn/full_build_guide_for_my_cfl_bucket_minimal_wiring/'>Hyroero's minimal wiring guide</a>. My bucket is pretty simple, it is a 5gal container with a <strong>UFO LED light on top</strong> and PC fans for ventilation."
