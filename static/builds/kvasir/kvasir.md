c: "It started as the most basic set up possible.. 2 buckets and 1 LED light bulb.. after visiting the space bucket websight I was sold! Had to build one myself.
I live in a camper in northern Michigan and it is currently -2° outside. The camper is warm and cozy but as heat rises and our heat source is a wallmount heater, you sweat from your chest up, and everything below is a cool 55° or so.. this said I had to change a few things about my bucket.
It has 2 12v fans from an old power inverter that came with my camper, and 1 120v fan from an old heater I torn apart..
My light head bucket is made up of 2 full spectrum 60w <a href='https://amzn.to/3lyKIRa'>LED bulbs</a> from Walmart, and 1x40w <a href='https://amzn.to/3jMfTYw'>CFL bulbs</a> that I had in a drawer. I also found 2 more buckets along the way..
I used aluminum tape for the interior of the bucket, and cut everything with my big Bowie knife.
Between hunting up free parts, and replanning my design about 7 times, I finally made a deduction as to how I am going to build..
So far I only have 3 day old sprouts in it but looks like it is working really well..
This is a project that will never be finished, and I plan on using red and blue <a href='https://amzn.to/30TZOZn'>5630SMD LED</a> strips around the entire interior of my center 2 buckets that house the 12v fans, and adding about 3 more <a href='https://amzn.to/3jMfTYw'>CFL bulbs</a> to the head when plant is closer to bloom. This is my first bucket, and second ever attempt at growing this type of plant. Everybody reading this is along in a journey with me.. I can't wait to see what the bucket turns into, and how well the plant turns out.. 
Total cost of build : $20 
Total time to build : just about a full day off and on taking my time.
I will post more pictures as I go, I hope it helps inspire your own ideas! Or completely copy mine.. just run the fans in the same direction as my blueprint.. I have fans reversed because of the cooler temps at floor level in my camper.. so it's sucking heat from the top of bucket to keep inside temps ideal.."
