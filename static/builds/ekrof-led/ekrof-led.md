c: "I've mostly finished my new lighting configuration. I like my light-tops to be <strong>self-sufficient</strong>, they can be stacked on any untouched 5gal bucket. This one features 5 14w LED bulbs with the cover removed, <strong>a glass shield for safety and temperature reasons</strong>, and two fans, one on the side and another one inside. There is an extra spacer on top that hides the wiring. I really like how that turned out."
