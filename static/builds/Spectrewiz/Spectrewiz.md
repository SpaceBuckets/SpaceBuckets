For the moment I'm using <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J7IOMCS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00J7IOMCS&linkCode=as2&tag=spacbuck-20&linkId=HIZCXETKN3XOMUBN'>23w CFL bulbs</a>, but I'm hoping to upgrade to an <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>UFO LED light</a> soon. A carbon filter is also in my plans, for now I've installed a light-trap near the fans. My intention is to fit some large plants in my setup as I gain more gardening experience! <strong>Wish me bucket-luck.</strong>"
