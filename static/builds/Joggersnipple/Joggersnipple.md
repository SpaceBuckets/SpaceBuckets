c: "This is my Space Bucket build! It took a few prototypes to get to this point, hope you like it. I cant wait to see what kind of plants it can produce! I have a top mounted exhaust fan with controls for my main lighting, a 180w UFO LED.  Switched the fan with a Noctua I had around. Also flipped the fan so it would be exhausting from the UFO. Mylar is held in place by duct tape inside the bucket, glue turned it transparent over time. I use this <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam'>IP webcam app</a> with a Samsung Galaxy S4 so I can check in on temps without having to open the bucket, you can also set up port forwarding so you can check it without being connected to your network."
