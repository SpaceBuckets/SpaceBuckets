c: "I decided to spend a couple hours today and build my bucket as I have germinated my first seed. I found some awesome potting mix at Walmart with peatmoss, vermiculite and perlite added already. Those couple hours turned into almost all day since my drill decided not to work anymore. But I got it done and just need to fix the small light leaks and tape up a couple more spacers."
