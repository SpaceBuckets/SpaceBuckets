c: "This is my second grow and bucket build! <strong>This SB is still a work in progress</strong> (the wires are just laying on the floor for the moment). I decided to use a <a href='http://amzn.to/1SUiCdJ'>4-way light adapter</a> with 23w CFLs bulbs, that was really easy to install. The walls of the bucket have 5630SMD LED side-lighting. Also using standard 8x8 PC fans hooked to a 12v supply for ventilation. The main container is a classic 5gal bucket."
