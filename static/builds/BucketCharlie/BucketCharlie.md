c: "This is my first bucket! I built a basic UFO setup with <strong>a 180w LED light on top and side-lights on the walls</strong>. The ambient temp is 70-75 degrees. I'm getting excellent throughput from my ventilation fans so I think I have a pretty airtight system, and the current 75 degree internal temp is with my fans running at half speed. I found that using a hot glue gun to install the fans was by far the easiest method of mounting with an airtight seal. <strong>I'm looking forward to experimenting!</strong>"
