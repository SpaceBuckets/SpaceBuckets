c: "This is my first ever bucket build! <strong>I went with the 5gal buckets and 4x23w CFL bulbs.</strong> I'm using the Philips mini-twister that have a smaller footprint. Also installed two 8x8 PC fans for airflow. I decided to skip the Mylar for now, used reflective white paint on the walls instead. I'm planning to grow veggies in my bucket, most likely basil and chives at first, though I might try some succulents in the near future. A"
