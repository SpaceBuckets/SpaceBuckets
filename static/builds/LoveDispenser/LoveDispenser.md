c: "I want to share my build. It had many iterations and fails, but it looks like its finally finished and I can relax and grow my plants. Features include: 200W of led strips + 130W UFO LED light; silent inline fan, acoustic ducting + carbon filter (no smell yet and very quiet noise); stealthy operation, no indication at all that there is something going on unless you open the closet; automatic arduino controlled watering system; Raspberry Pi logging air humidity, temperature (from 2 sensors, takes average) and soil moisture."
