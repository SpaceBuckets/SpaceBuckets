c: "<strong>This is my heat shield! </strong>Here are the instructions: 5' cut from bottom bucket. Mark and cut four evenly spaced tabs, bent in to grab light bucket. Vent holes cut according to bulb placement. Cut all but a small lip from the floor of the bucket. Plexiglass rests in lip. <strong>Done!</strong> I added some duct tape for peace of mind, first change will be to replace that with an infallible, but removable solution. <strong>My temps are even better than before!</strong>"
