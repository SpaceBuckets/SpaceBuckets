c: "This is my build! It is <strong>a modular design with boxes</strong> that stack, so you can go bigger if you need to. I hung the <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>UFO LED light</a> from chains so you can control the height of the lamp, instead of having it attached to the top like in this picture. I found these blue tote boxes where the handles are exactly as big as a 12cm fan. In the bottom of the box is a small wooden frame to keep the bag from touching the bottom so a little water can drain out there. The bag is a fabric pot I cut up."
