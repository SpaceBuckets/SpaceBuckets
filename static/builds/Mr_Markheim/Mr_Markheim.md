c: "Here is a small peek at my buckets! They have sections of <a href='https://amzn.to/30TZOZn'>5630SMD LED strips</a> running vertically equidistant around the interior of the bucket. In between the strips I have 2 sections of five 3W high power red LEDS that are attached to bucket with an aluminum heat sink. <strong>Both buckets are top lit by a <a href='http://amzn.to/2nszq3G'>100W LED chip</a> attached to a <a href='http://amzn.to/2mO7lp8'>CPU heat sink</a>.</strong>I want to express a <strong>huge thanks to this community for the amazing information that you have posted and so freely shared</strong>. Most of the real work was done by <a href='/u/ekrof'>Ekrof</a>, <a href='/u/superangryguy'>SAG</a>, and you amazing bucketeers out there."
