c: "I present my Space Can! I am very proud of this build. The can is running consistently at 72Â°F (notice the AC unit in the window). I'm using CFL bulbs and I run 2 CPU fans as intakes and another as an exhaust. <strong>I have all my connections soldered and heat shrinked</strong>. All fire hazard and shorting concerns were deeply looked at during R&D. I haven't had any problems. Thanks for looking!"
