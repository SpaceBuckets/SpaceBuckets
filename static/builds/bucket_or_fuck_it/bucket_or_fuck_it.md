c: "Howdy ya'll!<strong> This is my first Space Bucket build. </strong>I'm using a <a href='http://amzn.to/2rUPPCB'>180w UFO LED</a> and the standard 5gal buckets. I almost got everything put onto the bucket (still want to add a little watering tube and two more fans (one more intake and an outtake fan). Also for those curious the <a href='http://amzn.to/2rUDMoB'>Raspberry Pi</a> monitors temp/humidity and takes pictures every ten minutes and graphs out the data for me. It also texts me when the temp is lower than 70 or higher than 85."
