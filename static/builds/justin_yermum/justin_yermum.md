The main lighting setup features 4x23w <a href='https://amzn.to/3jMfTYw'>CFL bulbs</a>, and one LED bulb of unknown wattage. I have dual fans for removing heat, and one 5630SMD LED strip on the walls of the container. <strong>I grow hydroponically</strong>, I have a reservoir for the roots with a pump."
