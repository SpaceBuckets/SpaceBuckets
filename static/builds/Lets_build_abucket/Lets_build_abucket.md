I just upgraded to a UFO with light strip and after some tinkering have finally stabilized the temperature! I'm pretty happy with what I hope is my final design... for now. My theme is minimal wiring because I am very scared of electronics and fires. Ironically <strong>my husband is becoming an electrical engineer.</strong> He has promised me a bad ass light setup when he is done with school!

The light top is two spacers with the <strong><a href='http://amzn.to/2nmndjP'>UFO LED light</a></strong> set on top of the lid and duct taped on. The lid is not sealed to the exhaust spacers so I can easily peek in.
