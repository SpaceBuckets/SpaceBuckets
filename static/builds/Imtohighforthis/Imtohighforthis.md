c: "I decided to go with the basic build of a couple 5 gallons, CFL lights and PC fans. <strong>First time bucket builder and grower.</strong> The temperature with the lights on is usually around 70-75°F (21-24°C). I have been topping the plant in hopes it will keep the height to a minimum. Any ideas or recommendations are greatly appreciated. <strong>Happy gardening everyone!</strong>"
