c: "Thanks to all the great info here I just finished the mk1 prototype for my rain barrel bucket and wanted to know what you think of it. This is a 55 gal barrel with 8 cfls, 3 intake fans and 2 exhaust with filters. I am still going to add some side lights at some point but for now it's working great. The filters are just pencil holders from Walmart with a screen door material core. There 2 designs there, one with a cylinder core and another with a cone, I've gotta rebuild another cone one as they provide a little more efficient airflow through the carbon. All 5 fans I have are just pc fans."
