c: "<strong>Here is my first </strong>build! I used 2 three way splitter extension cords with plug to socket adapters for the bulbs. I would recommend not doing this, and using weatherized sockets with Y-socket adapters.<strong> If you don't feel like doing any wiring I recommend this however</strong>. I was originally going to use extension cords and mount the bulbs one by one, and would do that if I did another build. I used the high power fan for the top and it works great, I don't think I need to be concerned about any heat issues. <strong>Turned out better than expected. </strong>It was very hard to use a razor knife to cut the holes out for the bulbs, I would recommend using a dremel, which I did for some parts. I also have some side lighting LEDS im excited to install once I get started. Still doing last minute lightproofing on a few areas, but its all done! <strong>I had a great time with this build and can't wait to use it.</strong>"
