c: "This is my first Space Bucket! <strong>It is not perfect but I had a load of fun making it.</strong> I used fans from an old computer, a decent sized trash bin with a half spherical lid, a few LED strips and a bunch of <strong>other bits and pieces</strong>. One advantage of this bin is the lid, a half sphere shape gives more room for bulb placement. I prefer 5gal buckets though."
