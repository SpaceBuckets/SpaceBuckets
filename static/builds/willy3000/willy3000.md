c: "Here is my new tote garden! <strong>I have the <a href='http://amzn.to/1PDt1aN'>300 watt Mars Hydro</a> LED light (with the 5w chips)</strong> and a double strip of 5050SMD at 6000k. It's two strips together encased in a clear rubber like sleeve: pretty darned bright overall! The inside is painted flat white with an art product called <a href='http://amzn.to/1qerALf'>Gesso</a>, which is a canvas primer for oil painting. I'm also using <a href='http://amzn.to/1qeqWO3'>two AC Infinity fans</a>, one in one out at 51 cfm. <strong>Many thanks to the group and a special thanks to <a href='/u/exactly'>/u/exactly25schmeckles</a> who came up with the concept.</strong> I think this build turned out well!"
