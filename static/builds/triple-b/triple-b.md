Customized and friendly, <i>TRIPLE B </i>operates in a lightproof closet. Slightly cold during winter, lighting generates fortunately enough heat for the grow space (over 75°F/24°C inside). A red adhesive tape is used in order to highlight where <i>TRIPLE B </i>can be safely handled. This amazing Space Bucket was made thanks to the resources of the Spacebucketer community and especially Ekrof builds."
