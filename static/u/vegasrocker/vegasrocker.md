c: "My son and I decided to build 2 Space Buckets after he <strong>discovered them by accident on Reddit</strong>. He had Afghan Kush seeds that a friend gave him. Our 2 buckets have 1' of planting rock at the bottom for drainage, topped with 6' of FFOF soil and perlite mixed 70-30%. <strong>Living here in the desert </strong>where the Relative Humidity is always low, I have found that adding a bowl of water brings it up 5% to 15%. It needs refilling every day as it evaporates (adding humidity). Today the RH in Las Vegas is 28%, 36% in my closet, and 48% in the SB before watering. I just watered and the RH in the bucket is 56%. <strong>Every little bit helps.</strong>"
