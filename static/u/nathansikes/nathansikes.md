c: "This is my first bucket, made from spare parts. <strong>It's definitely tiny!</strong> It's a 2 gallon or so bucket from the usual source, with a stainless mixing bowl that happens to snugly fit the top. One string of Chinese grow LEDs stuck to the inside. <strong>Hoping to grow lettuce through the summer</strong> in the soilless mix."
