c: "This is my new indoor garden! I have two of these rigs built now too with the same totes. The first one i added zip ties to one side to allow it to act as a hinge. I open it up clam shell style to water it so far. <strong>For the top I am using a 300w UFO LED grow light</strong> which fits great with this container. This setup allows me to grow two or more plants at the same time, and it also works as a great starting point for clones or seedlings."
