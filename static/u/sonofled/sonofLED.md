c: "This is my second build! I went with white buckets. It cut some time out but I found that I had to double wrap the duct tape because a single layer was leaking light. Made another light catch for the 80mm intake on the side.<strong> Got a <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>180w UFO LED light</a> for about 80$ after shipping.</strong> I took the stock fan out of it and installed one of my 80mm fans as an exhaust on the UFO (the stock fan was not cutting it getting heat out of the bucket). I added a watering system also with a remote temperature/humidity reader. Also made a spacer  with a 60mm exhaust fan and a warm white LED strip. <strong>The Jalepeno plant is flourishing in this bucket!</strong>"
