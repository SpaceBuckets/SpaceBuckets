c: "This is my Space Bucket! It was inspired by <a href='/u/celebrindan'>/u/Celebrindan</a>. I used kitty litter buckets, foil tape to line the inside, a <a href='http://amzn.to/2nl5u9J'><strong>Roleandro 138W UFO</strong></a> (will probably add LED soft white strip lighting). The Bottom half is a draining reservoir. I only have one extension piece for now. I have two 80mm fans, one up a little higher to exhaust, the other to bring in fresh air. Temps after a full 24 hours are 72-78, while RH is at 56%."
