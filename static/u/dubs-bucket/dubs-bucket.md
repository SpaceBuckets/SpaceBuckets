c: "Hello! I'm new to the whole Space Buckets thing, and here is my build so far. I'm using 23w <a href='https://amzn.to/3jMfTYw'>CFL bulbs</a>, 2700K, 1600 Lumens. My garden has two intake fans, one 8x8 and another 10x10, which has helped to keep the heat under control. Temperatures stay at roughly 85F (29°C) when the lights are on and about 70-80F (21-26°C) when they are off. I am growing in the closet that you can see in the background. <strong>Thanks for looking and for all the help!</strong>"
