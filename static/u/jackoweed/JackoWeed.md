I've gone with 20L buckets with Mylar, <a href='http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=23w%20cfl&linkCode=ur2&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3A23w%20cfl&tag=spacbuck-20&url=search-alias%3Daps&linkId=TOD5YZ7WINHSD7WK'>2x23w and and 2x30w CFL bulbs</a>. Temps are around 26Â°C and humidity 30-40%. Scrog net is made from string and the top of a 10l pot rim. <strong>All this would not have been achieved if it wasn't for this community so I thank all bucketeers!</strong> I've never grown a thing in my life, and I'm absolutely LOVING it."
