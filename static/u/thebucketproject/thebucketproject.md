For lighting we are using a <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>240w UFO LED light</a> light, also firmly fixed onto the lid. We altered the UFO in a way that it doesn't need its original CPU-like ventsystem and instead uses the <a href='https://www.amazon.com/VIVOSUN-Inline-Ventilation-Variable-Controller/dp/B01CTM0H6I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=spacbuck-20&linkId=7d60537b9a3e8e0eefce012ceb366a47'>fat inline turbine</a> as a cooling aid for heat issues of the LEDs.<h3>BUCKET PLANS</h3><strong>We will only grow 1 plant in the barrel</strong>, for flowering as well. We are covering the barell with a very large blanket so total darkness will be ensured! They are currently sitting on a beercrate. Once the plant grows in size a little more were also thinking on painting the insides with white paint. Also got some led stripes to hit her from the sides once she grows bushy enough."
