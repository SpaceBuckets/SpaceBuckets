c: "LEDs are wired in series and the rings are independently powered. <strong>LEDs used: <a href='http://amzn.to/2mNnslb'>3W chips</a>, 445nm, 460nm, 630nm, 650nm.</strong> Veg will be for the inner 3 rings of the LED, Flower will be for the outer 2. During veg only the inner 3 rings should be turned on, once in to flower I will have both switched on. Each driver can handle up to 18x3w LEDs at 600mA and provides AC85-265V Constant Current, perfect for my needs. <strong>I'm using a <a href='http://amzn.to/2mNnvgM'>230mm fan</a>, 150 CFM and 26dBA.</strong>"
