c: "First step... <strong>remove the rabbit!</strong> I shopped around for these 20L buckets. Cheapest I could find here in Australia was K-mart at $9 in the camping/fishing section. I put 3 small pieces of tape where I thought the UFO hangers and the lid would meet. I then drilled the 3 holes and shaped with the craft knife. I used the clips to secure the <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>UFO LED light</a>. <strong>Awesome idea I'd seen in another build!</strong> Also reversed the fan in the back of the UFO make it an exhaust. No more warranty now! All done for today. <strong>Just waiting on <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002R9RBO0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002R9RBO0&linkCode=as2&tag=spacbuck-20&linkId=7A2LO6CV2AZYV5CP'>PC fans</a> to come in from China.</strong> There are a few gaps in the black tape which need going over, but i figured I'd wait until the fans arrive."
