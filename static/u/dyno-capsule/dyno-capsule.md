c: "Here is my new Space Bucket! It is a pretty basic build. I went with a 20 gallon white bucket with a <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>UFO LED light</a> for the main lighting. I also used a 50 CFM hobby fan taped to a Ziploc container. The fan/container combo is them attached to a 4 inch metal exhaust elbow. I wanted to have everything attached to the lid."
