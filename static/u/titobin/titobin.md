c: "<strong>Here's my progress for my Space Bin!</strong> I am using a UFO LED, it's a <strong><a href='http://amzn.to/2ocdy0h'>Meizhi 300w reflector series</a></strong>. I got the wheelie bin used. It wasn't used for trash and didn't stink one bit. I hit the outside with bed liner and the inside with white paint. Mounted the <strong>control box</strong> on the front, and a <a href='http://amzn.to/2pZqnYb'>4' inline fan</a> on the back. The exhaust grille for the fan is a 4x3 floor drain. Fits the 4' duct elbow. For the air inlets I'm going to use four 1-1/2 abs plumbing elbows. They should work as a bit of a light trap."
