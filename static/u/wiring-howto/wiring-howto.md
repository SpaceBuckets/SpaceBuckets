First we have the wires for each bulb split and stripped (I exposed about 30mm of the core to make the twisting easier). It's important to have the wires all of the exact same length with the exposed core of each cable beginning at the same point. Then twist the matching cables together: don't be gentle, you want a tight link. Trim the ends down so that they will fit inside of the single screw connector.
