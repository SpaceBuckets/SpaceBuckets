c: "So I made my first Space Bucket for another attempt on cloning my girls. Light socket puck sealed with waterproof reflective tape. 120mm PC fan for exhaust. Still looking for a compatible power supply. <strong>I'm using a single LED bulb for the moment.</strong> Made a stand out of plexiglass, hot glue bonds surprisingly well!"
