c: "Howdy! Thought you guys might like to see my afternoons work. I came home with a $4 bucket and a few hours later the seedling is in! My second bucket build was a lot easier than the first. The holes around the bottom are passive intakes. The fan on top is the exhaust. <strong>I've sealed all gaps around the fan, creating negative pressure inside the bucket.</strong> This ensures that the intake holes are always sucking in cool air, pushing the warm air upwards through the bucket. I will also be adding a USB fan inside  to give airflow directly to the plant and also create a little air turbulence.
    For the early seedling phase I'm using this cute little 8w LED panel. <strong>Its a photo/video light I had sitting in a drawer.</strong> The LED has a nice 90 degree mounting bar which saved some work. I'll add more light in a week or two. The seedling is only a few days old, so the 8w will be adequate to get it started."
