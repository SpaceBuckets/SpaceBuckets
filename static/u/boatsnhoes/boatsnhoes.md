c: "Here's the overall look to my garden! <strong>I had a lot of fun building this</strong>. I'm not really a crafty person, which goes to show that <strong>anyone can make a Space Bucket with the right amount of motivation</strong>, resources, and patience. It's all so exciting. Thanks everyone for your help!Installing the <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>UFO LED</a> (135w) to the lid was <strong>the biggest challenge</strong> because I don't have a driller, and the plastic was thick. It took a lot of patience stabbing and cutting but <strong>I made it work</strong>! The <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>UFO LED light</a> came with a few clips which I stuck through the lid and then secured with tape."
