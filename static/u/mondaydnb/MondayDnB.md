I have 4x23w <a href='https://amzn.to/3jMfTYw'>CFL bulbs</a> with 4 Outlet-To-Socket plugs. That made the build 10X easier, and I highly recommend it for beginners such as I. If you're not fond of wiring your own stuff, this is hands down the best way to do it. <strong>This has been a fun project and a GREAT bonding time with the wife!</strong><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceBuckets/comments/6gogh9/i_joined_the_team/'>Check the reddit thread</a> for detailed step-by-step instructions."
