I've got the raspberry PI taking temperatures and images, pinging them over the WiFi, I just need to hook up the web side of things which has been started.
    <strong>I built my first bucket as a DWC hydro bucket with <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>180w UFO LED light</a></strong>, and just added <a href='https://amzn.to/30TZOZn'>5630SMD LED</a>, and a big air stone/pump in the bucket. I'm growing Jalapeno chilli's and temperatures idle at about 27-30ºC (80ºF-86ºF), things seem OK but as I'm new to this its hard to tell. Wish me luck!"
