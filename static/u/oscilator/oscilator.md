I<strong>'m using a container that I found in my garage</strong>, it is 55cm high and 34cm wide. I chose a <a style='font-weighg:bold;color:#136baf;' href='http://amzn.to/1WRxtcm'>UFO LED light</a> that is really easy to install, just put it on top of the lid, plug and play. For airflow I have a 8×8 PC as intake and a 12×12 as exhaust, those are run with a 12v 1.4A power supply. Also used a pack of Mylar, aluminium tape. <strong>This is going to be both interesting and fun!</strong> I am going to try grow '7 pod' which is about 1.100.000 on the scoville heat level scale. <strong>And that is pretty damn hot!</strong>"
