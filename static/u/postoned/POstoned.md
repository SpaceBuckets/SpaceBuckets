c: "Hey fellow bucketeers! I'm a long time lurker and built already my first bucket with a <a href='http://amzn.to/2ntxwiZ'>Raspberry Pi</a> and web interface for monitoring. I've got a beautiful Pineapple Express plant! Thanks for that! But I wasn't so satisfied about the realization of my old bucket, so I built a new bucket/tote. <strong>Or maybe a new species? This is my all new Buckettron. </strong>The new features in addition to the old rPi controlling with a relay and temperature/humidity sensor, are an automatic watering system with a moisture sensor and pump. After moving into a new apartment I got some spare cable ducts from my network so I could build a cleaner design with the boxes and plugs."
