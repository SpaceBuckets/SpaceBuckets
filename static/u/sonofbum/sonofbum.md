Also special thank you to <a href='/u/ekrof'>ekrof</a> for keeping up with all these grows and builds. Now with my bucket: I'm using 4x23w and 1x42w <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J7IOMCS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00J7IOMCS&linkCode=as2&tag=spacbuck-20&linkId=HIZCXETKN3XOMUBN'>CFL bulbs</a>. For airflow I have a <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002R9RBO0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002R9RBO0&linkCode=as2&tag=spacbuck-20&linkId=7A2LO6CV2AZYV5CP'>12x12 PC fan</a> acting as an intake, and two 6x6 exhaust fans. <strong>So it's a pretty basic build with some spacers for the future.</strong> I have already started on my second bucket but want to finish some light leaks on this one, also put some sort of light catch on the top two fans."
