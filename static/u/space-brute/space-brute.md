c: "Hello! This is my interpretation of a <strong>Space Bucket aka 'Space Brute'</strong>. I didn't really use a guide per se but I just took elements from different builds that I liked and combined it into my own. I'm using an <a href='http://amzn.to/2ntHy3P'>Apollo 180W UFO</a> and I recently picked up some warm white LED strips that I'll install this weekend. I reversed the fan and mounted it with spacers to a bucket lid and secured it in a spacer. I then added a 4' outlet to connect to the flex duct. I also removed the power input from the <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>UFO LED</a> and integrated it into the lid for a cleaner look."
