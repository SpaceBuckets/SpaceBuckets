Came up with a great way of making a fan mount out of a piece of 1x4 board. Used a hole saw and then sanded it against a sheet of sandpaper wrapped around the bucket to give it the proper curve. Hit it with some black spray paint and attached with # 10 screws and added a dust filter on the outside."
