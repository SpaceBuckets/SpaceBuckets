I was inspired by <a href='http://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceBuckets/comments/1lmfqd/my_1st_results_56_watts_warm_white_leds_26_grams/'>SuperAngryGuy's hardware store LED bucket</a>, one of the best designs I've seen. Keep in mind that I still need to connect most things and I have to order some side-lightning. I went with a rain barrel and a bathroom fan. Also betting on <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H8M6V06/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00H8M6V06&linkCode=as2&tag=spacbuck-20&linkId=R6PIOCSFZQYBZ5UP'>10w LED bulbs</a>. <strong>I'm having so much fun building this! </strong> Indoor gardening is an amazing hobby. Great ideas on this community."
