c: "This is my first try at this. No nutes at all, basic soil, tap water up until the most recent watering, going with distilled for the remainder. I put 2.5' black 90* pvc intakes to <strong>keep light out </strong>and carbon filters on the bottom of the lid (we will see how well they work). The plastic material that <strong>blocks off most of the heat </strong>turned out great, a square piece I cut to size, cut a slit and slid into the side of the bucket. All four sides have a gap inside to <strong>maintain airflow </strong>while blocking the unwanted heat."
