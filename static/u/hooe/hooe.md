c: "<strong>Here is my first bucket build! </strong>No drain pan yet. The plant (jalape√±o) is in a pot inside the bucket. Two 80mm pc fans connected to a 12v 2a DC converter. I didn't do any improvised wiring, it's all stuff from the guides. <strong>I have a 180w LED grow light with the fans flipped. </strong>I also have two screws sitting in the side of the bucket to attach spacers later. I did this because I want more height than what I'd get from just the tops sitting stacked. Thanks for watching!"
