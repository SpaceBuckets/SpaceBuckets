c: "<strong>This is my Space Rocket!</strong> The main lighting is a 150w <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>UFO LED</a> (consumption about 50W). I also installed eight 4w COBs for side lights, powered with a 24w adapter and fixed on aluminium plates. The power supply is on top of bucket using the exhaust air for cooling. The small pan on the floor is for the drain water. The middle piece consists of 2 buckets sticked together with hot glue."
