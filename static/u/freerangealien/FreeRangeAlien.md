I've been watching all you guys and was nervous about building my own bucket <strong>but finally decided to get after it</strong>. And I'm glad I did! This is going to be a fun fall project for me. I use a <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>Roleadro UFO LED light</a> for the main lighting, and 5630SMD strips on the walls of the bucket. The light is brighter than I expected which is a good sign. It lights up my living room at night."
