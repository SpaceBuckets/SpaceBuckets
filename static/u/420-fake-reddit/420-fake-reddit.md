c: "Here is my first Space Bucket! <strong>There are some things left to do:</strong> mix up the bulb temperatures, attach the power strip and timer, drill holes in bottom of bucket, seal up lights & fans with glue gun, tape it up, and plant the feminized auto-flower seed I have. First time growing ANYTHING outside of some rooftop vegetables. Oh and still considering installing a little watering setup. <strong>Regardless I did all the shopping and setup in one day. Super fun!</strong>"
