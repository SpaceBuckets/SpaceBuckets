c: "Hey guys, here is my first Spacebucket build.<strong> I'm very proud of it!</strong> It's made of 2 garbage cans. I'm using 5x20w CFLs for the light-top and <strong><a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BPIWY28/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BPIWY28&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=spacbuck-20'>5050SMD LED side-lighting</a> on the walls</strong> of the bucket. I have two power supplies, one with 1A and another with 0.5A so I can make the fans spin faster or slower. They are connected with 4-pin plugs for faster changing. I'll buy a fan controller to make it more comfortable to regulate the speed if it gets too hot."
