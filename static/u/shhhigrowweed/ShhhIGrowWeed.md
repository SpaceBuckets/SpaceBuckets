c: "<strong>This is my first Space Bucket build! I call it the Death Star.</strong> I used a Brute container with all LED lighting: a <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>180w UFO LED light</a> on top and a <a href='https://www.amazon.com/LEDMO-SMD5630-Daylight-Non-waterproof-brightness/dp/B01339FVZS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1518805183&sr=8-2&keywords=5630&linkCode=ll1&tag=spacbuck-20&linkId=378ec93a50fcd6d152011db6fb3dbe7c'>5630SMD strip</a> on the walls. I coated the inside of the top can with mylar. I probably could have done this a lot neater, but it is just icing on the cake in terms of the light my babies will be getting. For airflow I went with a <a href='https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01C82SYZ0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=spacbuck-20&linkId=6314e6be5d70d365cf5e63d903f4d0b6'>Booster fan</a>, which works great for controlling temps inside the container."
