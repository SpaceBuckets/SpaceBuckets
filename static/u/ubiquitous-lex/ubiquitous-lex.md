c: "Hello bucketeers! Just finished building our first and glorious bucket garden.</strong><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceBuckets/comments/3hyl0q/our_first_bucket_item_list_and_gallery/'>Here you have a list </a>of the components. Overall cosg: ~200€ (about 228$) Seems like a high price, but LED + Carbon filter were bit expensive, and the equipment is more expensive in general here.<strong>I really recommend using a drill or a dremel</strong>, you don't want to mess with melting plastic on your screwdriver. Installation was really easy, the hardest part was getting the holes in the brute bin, but with sharp knifes and a drill it was just a matter of patience. The latter was also needed for the silicone to dry (used it to mount the fan on top). At the moment, we run a test to see how the temperatures develop. On the direct top we have ~29°C (~84°F), on the bottom (top of the plant pot) we have 26°C (~79°F) after 30min, will continue and see how it is after some time, but I hope this is the peak."
