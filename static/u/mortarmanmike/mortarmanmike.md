c: "<strong>This bucket is a work in progress!</strong> I want to redo the inside because I’m not 100% satisfied with my craftsmanship. The setup will consist of <strong>five 27w CFLs</strong>, LED strips with both 2700K and 6500K strands, and a every surface covered in Mylar or reflective tape. The intake is a 120v 120mm quiet fan mounted to HighTech3D mount. For the lighting my inspiration came from the blackout bucket found on this community. <strong>For the exhaust</strong>, I absolutely had to have a carbon filter. I was browsing setups and hadn’t seen this either. It kind of came to me one day and knew I wanted it mounted like this."
