 <br>
I'm using a Meanwell adjustable driver, passive heatsink cooling a Vero 18, elevated barrier+window screen for carbon when it gets stanky, and a Raspberry Pi Zero W for the timelapse/live feed.
 <br>
I have a fan splitter on the 12v line so I can add another fan to aid pulling air through the granulated carbon when I add it. <b>Any questions are more than welcome, I love this community!</b> I'm growing solely autoflowers so I don't have to worry about outside light."
