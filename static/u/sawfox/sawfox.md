c: "This is my bucket! I took <strong>a lot of inspiration from many builds</strong> and it's thanks to this community that I was able to design and build my own. The upturned top section has the upper rim (maybe the second one too, I can't remember) cut off so it fits flush together, just like the spacer. I thought this way (even though it may be awkward lifting it off later) would be better seeing as I didn't want the <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>UFO LED light</a> super close to the seedling. I figured with a SCROG addition later on it would keep together, either way we have a spacer up to a point."
