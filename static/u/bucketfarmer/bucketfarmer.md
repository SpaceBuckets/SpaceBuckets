The 80mm intake and 120mm exhaust fans run on a switchable power supply that allows me to change fan voltage in 3V increments up to 12V. Note that I purposely installed the lights this low in the deep top; I want to add a shallow DIY carbon filter before the fan that double serves as a light-trap/blocker. I will keep optimizing this build as I progress with my plants."
