c: "Here's my build! It is really simple. I went with what worked (the light and soil) and got rid of what didn't old bucket too confining, fans and filter not effective and Mylar lining laborious and annoying. For lighting I have a 300w <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>UFO LED</a> light taken from old build; left it in the old lid for more grow room. For airflow I have two 4' inline booster fans @ 90CFM (one in one out). The container is a 55gal feed drum. And of course a brand new little seedling inside (white candy seed from Attitude) Kind Soil/Coco Loco soil builde."
