c: "Thanks to everyone that has helped me in the process of building this little fella. This has been a step-by-step process, fixing problems I didn't anticipate as they cropped up, but I learned a lot in the process and I think this bucket is ready to go! I am using a <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>UFO LED light</a> for my main lighting and plenty of ventilation to keep things cool and clear."
