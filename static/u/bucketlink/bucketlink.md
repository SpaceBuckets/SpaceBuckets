c: "<strong>This was a fun project!</strong> I'm going to show it to as many people as I can: parents, in-laws, my neighbours. I want them to see it filled with cherry tomatoes. I'm an enthusiastic gardener but never used Space Buckets before. I look forward to learning how to grow my own!
  The plan is to <strong>build a <a href='/u/acrylic-heat-shield'>heat shield</a></strong> for the lid out of the flexible, sturdy and reflective plastic that auto stores sell for side mirror replacements. This will go between the fan and the lights. I'll place a 90Â° pipe bend and fit a guard to the outside of the fan blades."
