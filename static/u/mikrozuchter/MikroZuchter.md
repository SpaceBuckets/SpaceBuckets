c: "Current lighting includes only four 23w 2700K CFL's. <strong>I plan to add LED side lighting</strong> when I have chance, or build a seperate light-top that includes space for the four 23w CFL's and one 42w. As you can see, <strong>it's running a little cool </strong>at 19.2째C (66.9째F) so I only have the single 80mm top exhaust fan. The highest I've seen it reach is 26.6째C (80째F) after running all night so unless anything changes, I will only use the single exhaust fan and the lower passive intake."
