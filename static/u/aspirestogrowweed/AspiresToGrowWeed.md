c: "I'm using FFOF soil with 40% perlite in my Space Bucket, <strong>with 92 true watts of 6500k CFL</strong> (I also have a 2700k set for flowering). That means <a href='http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=23w%20cfl&linkCode=ur2&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3A23w%20cfl&tag=spacbuck-20&url=search-alias%3Daps&linkId=TOD5YZ7WINHSD7WK'>4x23w bulbs</a> horizontally placed.  plan on putting an intake fan and adding a carbon filter once I start flowering. <strong>Started this grow on a budget</strong>, I will get nutes, pH kit and LEDs soon. Using cardboard light traps for the moment."
