<b>The light is a Growtech 100w blurple with heatsink + fan and ground for safety (tested).</b> It has two 18mm fans, the bottom one pulling air in and the top one pushing air out. Temps top at 24 Celsius and humidity sits around 50 and 60%. It has 5 spacers, and with everything on measures about 1 meter in total height. It's made with 20 liter buckets."
