I also have PC fans for ventilation and a PC power supply to drive them. <strong>As an upgrade I added a fan moung:</strong> I got some pink polystyrene insulation foam from home depot, cut it a little oversized for the fan. Then taped a sheet of coarse sandpaper flat to my bucket and started sanding away. For mounting I just through bolted it to the bucket."
