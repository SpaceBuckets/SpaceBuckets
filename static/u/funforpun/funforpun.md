c: "<strong>This is my EuroBox modular setup!</strong> I'm using that rectangular container for the main environment. The <strong><a href='http://amzn.to/2oxK9Oj'>300w LED model</a></strong> is somewhat of a mystery. It is sold by a local outlet and serviced by them, but I believe the parts come directly from a Chinese OEM of some sort. The box on the outside has all the electronics that control the fans and the lights. Nothing fancy, just a power supply and controller for the fans and some timers for the lights. I have a <strong><a href='http://amzn.to/2pjzSSX'>Parrot FlowerPower</a></strong> Bluetooth sensor that measures temperature, soil water content, nutrient (salt) content and light levels."
