c: "This is my first tote build! <strong>I'm using a 300w LED panel, 4x120mm fans and 34gal containers. </strong>The top tote has the lid attached in the middle via duct tape. The two halves are separable by unlatching the handles on either side. Detaching the two halves allows access to the bottom half of the container, under the ScrOG, while the top half is accessible from the top cut out or the small side viewing hole."
