Tried to make a DIY filter, <strong>but it kinda sucks!</strong> I bought new carbon for a 'air purifier' I found at goodwill, then square-peg-round-hole'd it all into a cardboard box. Gotta love dat ducttape. Smell-wise, my house has no weed smell... until I open the closet it lives in. So really, the filter works well enough at this point, but I worry about it getting stanky as time goes on."
