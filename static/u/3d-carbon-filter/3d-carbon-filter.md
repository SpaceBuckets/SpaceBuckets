c: "This is my quick carbon filter! <strong>I made it with my 3D printer for removing smells from my bucket</strong>. Used aluminium mesh from bug screen door to line inside and keep activated carbon in place. This design is made to fit a 100mm high flow fan. The files to print this filter are freely available on <a href='https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2602184'>Thingiverse</a>,"
