c: "Worried about energy consumption? Install a <strong>programmable thermostat</strong> inline with your exhaust system! I made this tutorial to show just how easy and cheap it is to add automation to buckets and totes. If you don't like programming your own system with a <a href='http://amzn.to/2nb9OtH'>Raspberry Pi</a> or an <a href='http://amzn.to/2nb1yKl'>Arduino</a>, here is a <strong>cheap and easy solution</strong> that you can use as a template. I used a <a href='http://amzn.to/2nknKCn'>12v Relay LED digital thermostat switch sensor</a>. I don't recommend using this for more than 24v. The power supply is 12v and 6A: overkill for one PC fan and a thermostat, but that leaves me room for upgrades. I added a diagram of the 4 wire cord and 4 port terminal connections. Switching is done after the load (which is not normal) but control wiring is a different game."
