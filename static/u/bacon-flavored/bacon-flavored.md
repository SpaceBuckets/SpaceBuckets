c: "This is my Space Bucket! <strong>I use 5M of 5050SMD LEDs and 4 <a href='https://amzn.to/3jMfTYw'>CFL bulbs</a></strong> in a 4 way adapter. I use <strong>a combination of topping and hardcore LST</strong> to shape the plant and then specific defoliation to develop the canopy. Anything below the lighting spacer is removed as well as anything blocking light to budsites. When the plant reaches 40% of the planned height it gets flipped to flower.

  <h3>PLANT NUTRIENTS</h3>
  Soil is 2:1 happy frog and perlite amended with ~6 tablespoons of dolomitic lime. I feed the plant whenever it's dry enough for the smart pot to feel light. When she gets a full feeding I use <strong>calmag and fox farms trio</strong> (grow big and big bloom during veg, tiger bloom and big bloom during flower) at the recommended dosage."
