c: "Hi space bucket folks! Here is my first build (<a href='http://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceBuckets/comments/2n3nel/bucket_build_out_pics_album/'>more pics here</a>). I'm at the stage of testing the temperatures and also relative humidity. Next steps are to tack down the wiring and power supply, buy a cabinet to stash the bucket in... <strong>and then start growing!</strong>Shout out to /u/mcscroggins for posting his <a href='http://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceBuckets/comments/1t590b/complete_build_guide_for_a_blackout_space_bucket/'>great build pictorial</a>. I referred to it while building. And thanks to <strong>this awesome bucket community</strong> for posting pics of their builds for ideas and such!"
