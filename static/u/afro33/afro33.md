c: "This is the <strong>APBucket.</strong> The aim of this project is to create an easy to mount, as-cheap-as-possible <strong>open source universal embeded <a href='http://amzn.to/2oU9I8R'>Arduino</a> program</strong> that could control climate of any indoor garden to make plants grow in ideal conditions. To ensure this, a series of measurement devices, climate control devices and lightning devices must be controlled. I also used custom <strong><a href='http://amzn.to/2oO3Iln'>LED lighting with 3w chips</a></strong>. Just two months ago started the adventure of building my first bucket with a custom led light and just <strong>found a hobby</strong> for a lot of years to come. <strong>The Bucket Designer was very useful</strong>, it let me design a prototype really fast, and show the world what I wanted to build."
