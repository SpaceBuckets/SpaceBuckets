c: "This is my first Space Bucket build! Any advice is appreciated. <strong>I am using a <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>UFO LED light</a> for the top lighting</strong>, and PC fans on the walls for ventilation. Also using some bright 5630SMD LED strips for side lighting, one cool and one warm white. I recently purchased a pot to plant in and have had to re cut my intake fan as it was too low. Moved it up only and inch or so (its now about level with top of my pot) CRISIS AVERTED!"
