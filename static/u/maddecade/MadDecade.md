c: "I'm very excited to share with you all my recent project! <strong>I have built my Bud Tank.</strong> I spent a ton of time researching/building this tote garden. I'm using 3 sockets with 3 Y splitters, <strong>six <a href='http://amzn.to/1Yfg5hw'>23 watt CFL bulbs</a> with reflective tape</strong> on the mount for a total of 138W. I've got a simple plug in fan that I mounted to the inside of the tote to help with air circulation. I'm using Miracle grow and tap water right now (I know I need a <a href='http://amzn.to/23ceKz0'>PH meter</a>), but I have plans to transplant into foxfarm ocean forest once I get my female! I also need to black out the exterior more but a blanket will do the trick in the mean time."
