c: "I looked at this website for ideas and really liked <a href='/u/spacetotebuilder'>/u/spacetotebuilder Space Tote</a>. I used two 27gal totes and a <strong>300w <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>UFO LED light</a></strong> as the main lighting. The walls have a 5630SMD LED strip, and two PC fans for intake and exhaust. There is also a seedling heat mat in there that I use when the temperature gets cool. Finally, I have a Logitech C920 connected to a raspberry pi (temporary until I get sensors and another camera for it). I am growing green bush bean, <strong>green onion, radishes and a mystery tobasco, alongside carolina reapers and white fatalii</strong>."
