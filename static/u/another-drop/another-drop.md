My intention was to be as low profile as possible and I'm really excited about the results so far. <strong>I lucked out with the buckets</strong> because they had passive venting light traps built in! Functional and aesthetically pleasing. <strong>Thanks for being an awesome resource so far Space Buckets!</strong>"
