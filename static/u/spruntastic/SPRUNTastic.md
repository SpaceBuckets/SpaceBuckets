c: "This is my bucket! <strong>There are many like it, but this one is mine. </strong>The only thing I payed for is the big grow light. Everything else I've had around the house for years, like the metal garbage can. <strong>I feel like a motivated MacGyver.</strong> The fans at the top and bottom are an old CPU and case fan. Thinking I have room for one, maybe two plants.  I'm not trying to start an operation... Nor do I know if I can even grow anything. Wish me luck!"
