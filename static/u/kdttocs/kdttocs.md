c: "This is my tallboy build! I am very proud of it. The design is tall, slim, with no ugly things attached to the sides; <strong>and most importantly, with no noticeable smell</strong>. Went with the hourglass configuration after considering the options. This gave me the best starting point for my design without needing a bunch of spacers at the start. I'm using a <strong><a href='http://amzn.to/2siw8Rt'>130w UFO LED light</a></strong> and an inline fan with a carbon filter. <a href='http://imgur.com/a/4WnBl'>Check more details at the album</a>."
