c: "Hey everyone! This is my garden. I wanted to say <strong>thank you for the amazing knowledge</strong> of this community. For lighting I have a <a href='http://amzn.to/2ncfxRD'>UFO LED light</a> and <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BPIWY28/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BPIWY28&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=spacbuck-20'>LED strips</a> on the walls. Airflow is managed by a <a href='http://amzn.to/2oDnAaA'>110v fan</a>. I'm using <a href='http://amzn.to/2onX9lA'>ONA Gel (1qt.)</a> to keep smell down, but I'm thinking of upgrading to a carbon filter as it starts to get into veg. I decided to use all organic hot soil and so far have used zero nutes (with the exception of cal-mag for correcting deficiencies)."
