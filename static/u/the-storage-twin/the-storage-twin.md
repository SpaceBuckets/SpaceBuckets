c: "So this is my first go a space bucket set up. I was tossing up on what kind of bucket to use. In the end I went for two 100L storage cases. The main reason I we for them was that I’ll be able to grow two plants at a time. I’ve got a nice little full spectrum led grow panel and led strip lights around the side. Two cheap ($5) desk fans as exhaust. I spray painted the inside white, added some reflective tape and I’m good to grow. Here’s to hoping I get a nice little crop."
