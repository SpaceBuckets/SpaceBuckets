c: "I have two <a href='https://amzn.to/3jMfTYw'>CFL bulbs</a> totaling 3200 lumens (5000K and 6500K). One exhaust fan, exchanging 85 cubic feet of air per minute and one air intake hole two inches in diameter. <strong>The lights can be raised and lowered simply by lifting up on the cord and tying it down</strong>. While the lights are lowered it provides another air intake. Everything was installed through the lid. Fan on one side, light hole in the middle, air intake on the other side. The fan is hung down flush with the plastic of the lid, kept from falling down with glue from a hot glue gun on the corners. Not even a power strip glued or taped to the side - the cords reach right to an outlet. <strong>The entire set up can be dismantled in 60 seconds.</strong>"
