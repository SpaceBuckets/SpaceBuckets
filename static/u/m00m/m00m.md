c: "<strong>After a month of reading everything</strong> on here I've put together a bin. My first time growing Indoors! I've installed a 300w generic LED panel (didn't flip the fans), two 80mm fans (intake and one exhaust), two timers and also a surge protector. <strong>This build is still work in progress</strong>, I still have to put in flat white pain on the inside. I plan to install 5 meters of 5050SMD LEDs for side-lighting, I will be putting it on a ring of plastic so I can move up and down it if needed. In the future I will add another 120mm fan for the exhaust, and I'll probably put some activated carbon in between. If smell is too strong will get a proper 4' inline fan and filter. <strong>Thanks everyone for all the helpful advice! </strong>"
