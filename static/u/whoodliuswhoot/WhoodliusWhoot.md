I'm using a brute container for extra space. <strong>For the top lighting I have a <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>180w UFO LED light</a>, and </strong>I plan to upgrade the walls with 5630SMD LED side lighting. I decided to give the top of the lid an artistic touch which resulted in a funky design. Thanks for looking!"
