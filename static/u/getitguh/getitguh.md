c: "This is our take on a Space Bucket! The build <strong>is still work in progress</strong>. I'm using <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J7IOMCS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00J7IOMCS&linkCode=as2&tag=spacbuck-20&linkId=HIZCXETKN3XOMUBN'>6x23w CFL bulbs</a>, but I will upgrade to 42w soon. Also betting on <strong>5050SMD LEDs</strong>, I've got two rolls on the walls (10 meters). Using <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002R9RBO0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002R9RBO0&linkCode=as2&tag=spacbuck-20&linkId=7A2LO6CV2AZYV5CP'>6x110mm fans</a> for airflow. The power strip will be installed <strong>outside the container</strong>, as it is much safer that way."
