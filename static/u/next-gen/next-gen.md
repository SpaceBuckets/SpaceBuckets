c: "I want to share with you the bucket I've been working on. I call it a next-gen build because it feels like a step forward from my previous iterations. The main protagonist is this BioLED light, a very powerful LED solution from a local manufacturer in my country. It has OSRAM chips and works really well without a fan. This light includes an extra power outlet, so I can plug two line fans for extracting on top and intake on the side. I added a light trap using a piece of bucket that I cut and taped up."
