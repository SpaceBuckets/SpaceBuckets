c: "Hello fellow bucketeers! <strong>I want to show you my new hybrid and improved build. </strong>I've been checking on bucket designs here and there. I came across a design by <a href='/u/zuchtertote'>/u/MirkoZuchter</a> recently that I must say, currently, is awesome and it's so simplistic and cheap. In terms of lighting, I wanted to sway away from cfls and try LEDs, so I got a 300w panel. For fans, I have two 120mm fans, with 3 speed switches. The fans themselves can pop out of the bucket, if I need more intake or exhaust. I have one exhaust and one intake currently, just right conditions in the bucket."
