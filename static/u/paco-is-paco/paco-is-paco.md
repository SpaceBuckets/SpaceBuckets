c: "I'm running my first bucket! Based on the advice I've gathered from this community I'm using a 180w <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>UFO LED light</a> for top lighting and 5m of <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F5KJ7GI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00F5KJ7GI&linkCode=as2&tag=spacbuck-20&linkId=BFVJMFGS6AOAPS4Q'>5050SMD strips</a> in a two bucket high stack. <strong>Very little wiring needed to be done. </strong>I soldered a few connections to use my own power supply but the LED strip kit had a very convenient PSU. The <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>UFO LED</a> has its own power cord that just plugs in. <strong>Wish me luck bucketeers!</strong>"
