c: "This is my second setup! My goal on this was to give <strong>the appearance of a normal garbage can </strong>if somebody took a quick glance. I mounted everything on the back - two AC Infinity USB 80 mm fans on the bottom for intake, two 120 mm fans on top for exhaust. A generic <a href='http://amzn.to/2sTFXty'>300w (130ish real) UFO LED</a> hung from the lid. When the lid is open, the light goes with it. The drawback is that <strong>there's no easy way to expand</strong> like you can with buckets, so training the plant is a must."
