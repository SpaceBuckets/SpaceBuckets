c: "Hi all! I've been lurking for a few months now, finished my first bucket a week ago, then helped another friend build his. I used <a href='http://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceBuckets/comments/1t590b/complete_build_guide_for_a_blackout_space_bucket/'>/u/mcscroggins Complete Build Guide</a> for a 'Blackout' Space Bucket. So shoutout there! nice detailed guide. I did a little different and only added one extention on my light top wiring, instead of adding more wires to all three sockets. Wanted to say <strong>thanks to the community for all the resources and information</strong> you share."
