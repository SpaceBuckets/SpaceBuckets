I'm growing with a <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>UFO LED light</a>, and I'll be adding some LED strips once my sprout gets bigger. <strong>You might find my carbon filter solution interesting. </strong>It's 2 PC fans on either end of a PVC pipe bend, with 1/3rd filled with activated carbon, kept in by a piece of stocking. It lasted a whole grow cycle with minimal smell."
