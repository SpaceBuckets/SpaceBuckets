c: "This is my first Space Bucket! I went with a standard 5gal build. I have Two PC fans stacked on top of each other as purge. A plastic duct grate separates the single-bulb ikea fixture I already had from the 4-bulb splitter. The grate allows the entire light area to vent. I wasn't sure what LED light bulbs to get, so I went for cheap. $2-3 each for 60W equivalent. Got warm and daylight for flower and veg. I'm using a 3 gal smart pot with a stake-in watering ring connected to an exterior valve."
