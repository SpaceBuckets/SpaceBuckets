c: "I'd like to preface this by stating that <strong>this is my first grow ever</strong>. The orange build has 3 buckets (1 bucket and 2 spacers) with a <a href='http://amzn.to/2nFDv3r'>Roleadro UFO LED light</a> (138W). I'm using 2x80mm PC fans that I had laying around for ventilation. Meanwhile, the big bucket is using a 20gal brute for the main container, a 32gal brute for the spacer. In this case the lighting is a <a href='http://amzn.to/2ncfxRD'><strong>300w UFO LED light</strong></a> by MarsHydro. I have five meters of 5630SMD LEDs on the walls and <a href='http://amzn.to/2oDnAaA'>2x120v fans</a> for airflow."
