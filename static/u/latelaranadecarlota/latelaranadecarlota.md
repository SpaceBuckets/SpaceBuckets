c: "<strong>I wanted a clean look</strong> with only one extension cord from the whole apparatus. The upper compartment contains an inline fan and the power source for everything, the lower portion is the grow area. In the pics you can see the inline fan and the top portion of the light fixture. There is a PVC pipe with a clamp that can be moved up and down so I can adjust how close the lights are to the plants. The carbon filter is in the back and the light fixture in front. This lid fits onto the top of the bucket and they protrude down into it. <strong>The carbon filter set up is my favorite part of the design! </strong>It is cut through the lid and the in-line fan draws from it attached on the inside of the top part of the apparatus. 
  I have the bucket lined with a reflective insulation material from Amazon. It fits inside the bucket like a liner. Its really nice because it holds its shape and <strong>I could anchor LED grow lights into it</strong> without having a bunch of holes visible in the side of my bucket. I can also run wires through there and it still looks really clean from the outside. Wish me luck!"
