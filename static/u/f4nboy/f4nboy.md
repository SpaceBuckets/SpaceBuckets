c: "This is my SB v2.0 build! It is held together with more than tape and gravity. The lamp is set up to 5x30w <a href='https://amzn.to/3jMfTYw'>CFL bulbs</a>, mounted on a photography light adaptor. The only issue I have is how down the bucket they go due to the angle. Need to create a spacer with a heatshield possibly. For airflow I'm using two computer exhaust fans, nothing fancy. You can see first clips holding vivarium heat cable that I use to protect from the cold temperatures during the winter."
