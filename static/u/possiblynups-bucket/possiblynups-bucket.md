c: "Hello Bucketeers! What great things these buckets are. I've been enjoying messing with this DIY project enormously. Haven't enjoyed/learned this much from a project in a good while. I'v nearly been enjoying the bucket more then it's aim... Enough waffling though, onto the build. This is my first bucket (it has been revised a good few times), but now it's at the point at which i'm happy enough with it to share. Here's what it looks like;
    Using the LED as a main light was gotten through SAG's excellent guide, and has given me great results. The water cooler is great for it, making the voltage booster the limiting factor. Later I plan on using a power supply along with a better LED and try to 'overclock' (overvolt?) it. The side lights are not being used (the ones visible form the outside, not the LED strip) as they have too high a beam angle (30Degrees) and do too much damage to the leaves.

    <b><u>Future Plans</u></b>

    I live at relatively high latitude (53) making it difficult for the ol' plant to be happy in a room during winter without having to heat the whole thing (which is silly just for the one bucket). Having lurked for a while on the Reddit forums, and seeing nothing 'standard' for this problem I decided to have some fun and keep the DIYing going.
    Making a water-warmed system in the bucket's soil, like the opposite of pc water cooling, seemed like a good bet. The biggest obstacle was keeping the delicate roots at a happy temp without breaking the bank. An aquarium heater turns out to be made for this. Being relatively cheap and made to handle the ambient temps of sensitive little fishies - it's made for this.
    Here is a picture + schematic of the loop. (I haven't gotten to try it, as having planted the current girl directly into 20L of soil, which would have been too difficult to transplant. So the next one will try this heater out. Despite the fact that temps inside should be OK by then).

    A quick test of the loop/system has given good results, managing to keep the water and soil pretty stable. Bare in mind that the aim isn't to keep the soil at optimal temps 100% of the time, but rather to lessen the drop of the temperature at night and stop the bad stunning/reactions of the plant that occurred in the current (first) grow. Well that's all for now, <span style='font-size: 17.2px;line-heighg: 1.6em'>thanks for reading and a huge thanks to Ekrof, SAG and the rest of the super-active community."
