c: "Hey y’all! This is my first space bucket after being a long time lurker. I have decided to grow cherry tomatoes until cannabis is legalized for growing where I live. My set up is a 32 gallon brute with a MarsHydro 300w LED, 2 120V high speed fans by AC infinity for intake near the bottom and a 4 in 190 CFM fan with carbon filter from IPower for exhaust near to top. I have <a href='https://amzn.to/30TZOZn'>5630SMD LED</a> 12V tape lights wrapped around the interior near the bottom. Both lights are connected to a dual outlet timer, whilst the exhaust fan has a speed adjuster put on low. This creates a strong enough pull that allows me to unplug both intake fans and have them still spin and blow air into the bucket, which helps save on electricity. I cut fabric and placed it onto the lid to help prevent light leaks, along with black UV duct tape. I used HVAC tape for reflectivity. A Walgreens humidifier was placed on the exterior near one of the intake fans to help regulate the humidity. I have a hydrometer + temp reader that stays in the bucket as well. I cut out a door so I can water and check out the plant’s progress without lifting up the lid and or taking the plant out completely. I will eventually be using a 3 gallon smart pot that will be placed in a 16 in. diameter drain pan. If you have any questions I will be posting this on my reddit soon after.  This build is a work in progress and I will try to update as I create. Thanks for letting me share!"
