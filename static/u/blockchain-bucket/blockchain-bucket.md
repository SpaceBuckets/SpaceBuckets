c: "<strong>We created an IoT enabled Space Bucket </strong>you can monitor and control over the internet, using the Ethereum blockchain. It uses a Raspberry Pi with relays to control 80mm PC fans, a 36V (100W) Citizen CLU048 COB LED, and 5-12v mini water pump. Attached to the Pi is Arduino Nano with DHT11 temp/humidity sensor, FC-28 soil moisture sensor, and photocell. The RasPi runs an Ethereum node that is synced to a smart contract written specifically for monitoring and controlling the bucket remotely. <a href='https://youtu.be/OBxyGAILqfE'>We made a video with all the information</a>."
