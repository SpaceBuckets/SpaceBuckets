c: "This is my DIY filter! It works pretty well. Reduces the smell about 95%. I'm going to crush up the pellets and see if it can completely remove the smell. I used <a href='http://amzn.to/2meViz5'>this fan</a> and <a href='http://amzn.to/2mSETUl'>this fan</a>. If noise wasn't a concern, I would have gotten the more powerful version of these fans that have greater airflow <a href='http://amzn.to/2nam2QO'>like this monster fan</a>. <strong>But all in all, it works really well and the design makes it easy to take on and off </strong>so you're able to make adjustments."
