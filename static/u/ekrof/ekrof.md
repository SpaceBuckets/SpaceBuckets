c: "This is the bucket garden that <strong>inspired this website</strong>. It features a light-top with about 130 true watts of CFL, with 2x42w and 2x23w bulbs. It has 8x8 220v fans and a <strong>glass heat shield</strong>, which works like a cooltube and keeps temperatures under control. <strong>Side-lighting is another feature</strong>, with 5050SMD LED strips fitted into bucket spacers. The next key is the <strong>SCROG net</strong>, which uses a top from a 10L mini-bucket, stacked on top of the plant for easier training in flower."
