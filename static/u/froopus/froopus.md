c: "This is my first attempt at gardening and <strong>I have been enjoying it since day 1</strong>. Growing under <a href='http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=23w%20cfl&linkCode=ur2&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3A23w%20cfl&tag=spacbuck-20&url=search-alias%3Daps&linkId=TOD5YZ7WINHSD7WK'>4x23w 5000K CFLs</a> with no dark period. The soil is premixed by my local grow shop is working well so far. I added a <strong>reflector disk </strong>around the plant and it brightens up the place a bit. I'm using a cheap 80mm PC fan on the side as an intake and <strong>a little beefier 120mm on the top</strong> as exhaust, I think the one on the top moves ~ 60cfm and the side ~30cfm. The bucket stays about a degree above room temperature."
