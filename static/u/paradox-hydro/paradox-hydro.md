c: "Here's my first build. <strong>I really wanted to play around with automation</strong>, since I was hoping to have a minimum maintenance setup. I haven't had to touch or adjust anything in about a week, and the plants seem to consume 1-2 gallons of water a week. The plant health <strong>livestreams to my server</strong> where I've been tracking all the sensor data. I've been working on designing a cheap opensource control board to handle all the electronics in a more pleasant, but for now it's just managed by a <a href='http://amzn.to/2nd9OYJ'><strong>Raspberry Pi</strong></a> and some relays. All of this was based on existing builds with some random bits that <strong>I thought would be fun to try</strong>."
