c: "This is my hydro build!<strong> I'm using a standard DWC setup: airpump, airstone, nutrients. </strong>The roots are just submerged in the liquid. Thinking of just putting a shroud around the pvc. I used a small hole saw to cut a hole in the lid of the bucket. Pushed the aerogarden net/insert with sponge in there. Two holes on the top of the bucket: one for the siphon and for the air tube."
