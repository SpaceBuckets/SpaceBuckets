This is my new bucket and my new plant.</strong> I’m using a classic <a href='https://amzn.to/3jMfTYw'>CFL bulbs</a> build with 2x60w, and two sets of LED strips for side lighting (5050 and 7020SMD). On top of the bucket you’ll see four switches, those allow me to control the fan speed. Still working on a watering system, I have to tweak the one I’ve installed."
