c: "Finally got the <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>135w UFO LED light</a>. Here's the almost final product. What was really cool was flipping the bucket upside down, that was a perfect fict! The recommendation from the paper work said to keep the plants about 24-48' away there about 16-17. Added the side lighting as well, <strong>I'm using <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BPIWY28/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00BPIWY28&linkCode=as2&tag=spacbuck-20'>5050SMD LED strips</a></strong>. Barely any heat and I know about the light leaks. I'm going to get some <strong>90degree PBS piping </strong>to help with that. Thanks everyone in this awesome community!"
