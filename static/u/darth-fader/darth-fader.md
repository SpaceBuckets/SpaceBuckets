c: "It started off clean and beautiful, however beauty and simplicity soon made way to <strong>functionality and technology</strong>: thus I present to you the aptly named... Darth Fader ('What is thy bidding, my rasta?'). I'm super happy with how it turned out... I've been known to not-finish projects, so to complete this to a point where it looks somewhat similar to how it should is deeply satisfying! I am thankful to this friendly community for all its knowledge thus far. <strong>And now comes the fun part, learning all about how to grow plants.</strong>"
