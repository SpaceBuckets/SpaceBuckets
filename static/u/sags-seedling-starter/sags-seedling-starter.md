c: "This is a cheap and effective design for seedlings and clones created by <a href='/u/superangryguy'>/u/superangryguy</a> (also known as the Bucket Scientist). 

    <strong>Don't over pay for something that costs less than $10 to make</strong> and will likely work better than commercial products. This DIY seedling bucket is what I use. The key is to make a bucket lid with a 40 watt equivalent bulb for clones or 60 watts for seedlings. The '60 watt' bulbs are being sold for $2 each at Home Depot or similar stores, so this is a great option for people with tight budgets.

    It is important to <strong>remove the outer glass or plastic diffuser of the bulb</strong> and make sure the LEDs are all pointing the same way. This will optimize the lighting configuration. <strong>Stick peat pots or whatever you wish inside your bucket. </strong> Its a good idea to <strong>mist the sides of bucket </strong>for humidity. You do not have to snap the lid down, just place it on top. Continue to mist as needed by the plant.

    That is it! You now have a bucket chamber for starting your clones and seedlings."
