c: "The black electrical tape is usually less than an inch wide, and requires a lot to do a whole bucket. The <strong>aluminum tape is kind of expensive</strong>, but doing both jobs is something to consider. One thing to consider is that the tape is a conductor of electricity so care is required to prevent shorts/grounding. <strong>Use well insulated fixtures and good connections</strong>. The <strong>LED lights</strong> were given to me by a friend and the boxes were blank, devoid of identity, as are the bulbs, save for a model #HG108."
