c: "Everything is up to code,<strong> I'm using GFCI and high quality electrical components and wiring</strong>. Every connection is soldered and heat shrink shielded. Safety first bucketeers! For airflow I have 120mm fans, two intake two exhaust. Working on light traps, I've got dust screens on the intakes. My lighting is a <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>135w UFO LED light</a> and 4 <a href='https://amzn.to/3jMfTYw'>CFL bulbs</a> (cool). <strong>Also using a <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F5KJ7GI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00F5KJ7GI&linkCode=as2&tag=spacbuck-20&linkId=BFVJMFGS6AOAPS4Q'>5630SMD LED strip</a> for flower (warm)</strong>. Should be able to get them nice and big with this setup!"
