<p>It's easy to get <b>'efficacy' (how well something works)</b> and <a href='/docs/luminous-efficiency'>'efficiency' (ratio of useful work)</a> confused. As we'll see, knowing this difference helps us make LED efficiency calculations and understand why red LEDs are used in grow lights.</p>

<p class='quote'>As lighting efficiency improves, it is useful to understand the theoretical limits to luminous efficacy for light that we perceive as white. Independent of the efficiency with which photons are generated, <b>there exists a spectrally imposed limit to the luminous efficacy of any source of photons</b>. We find that, depending on the acceptable bandpass and—to a lesser extent—the color temperature of the light, <b>the ideal white light source achieves a spectral luminous efficacy of 250–370 lm/W</b>.

<h3>Key Efficacy Concepts</h3>
<p>The following points mean that we can theoretically get about 47% more light for the energy input with 660nm LEDs versus 450nm LEDs. It explains why red LEDs are breaking the 4 µmol/joule barrier, and white LEDs based on blue LEDs with a phosphor never will. Green LEDs are electrically inefficient and is a physics/semiconductor issue (our eyes are most sensitive to green light so we don't notice).</P>

<ul>
<li><b>1240/wavelength of light in nanometers</b> = energy of a photon in eV (electron volts).</li>

<li><b>10.37/eV of photon</b> = µmol/joule or the maximum possible PPE (photosynthetic photon efficacy).</li>

<li><b>Max possible PPE * LED efficiency</b> = the PPE for the specific LED</li>

<li><b>Example:</b> 660nm photon. (1240/660=1.88eV) (10.37/1.88=5.52 µmol/joule). At 100% efficiency, a red 660nm LED would have a PPE of 5.52 µmol/joule.</li>

<li><b>Example:</b> 450nm photon. (1240/450=2.76eV) (10.37/2.76=3.76 µmol/joule). At 100% efficiency, a blue 450nm LED would have a PPE of 3.76 µmol/joule.</li>

<li><b>Question:</b> what is the electrical efficiency of a 660nm LED with a PPE of 2.8 µmol/joule? (1240/660=1.88eV) (10.37/1.88=5.52 µmol/joule) (2.8 µmol/joule/5.52 µmol/joule=50.7% efficient)</li>

<li><b>Question:</b> what is the electrical efficiency of a 450nm LED with a PPE of 2.8 µmol/joule? (1240/450=2.76eV) (10.37/2.76=3.76 µmol/joule) (2.8 µmol/joule/3.76 µmol/joule=74% efficient)</li>
