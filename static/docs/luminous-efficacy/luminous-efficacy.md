    > As lighting efficiency improves, it is useful to understand the theoretical limits to luminous efficacy for light that we perceive as white. Independent of the efficiency with which photons are generated, **there exists a spectrally imposed limit to the luminous efficacy of any source of photons**. We find that, depending on the acceptable bandpass and—to a lesser extent—the color temperature of the light, **the ideal white light source achieves a spectral luminous efficacy of 250–370 lm/W**. Thomas W. Murphy, [Maximum spectral luminous efficacy of white light](https://tmurphy.physics.ucsd.edu/papers/JAP_111_104909.pdf)

    ### Key Efficacy Concepts

    The following points mean that we can theoretically get about 47% more light for the energy input with 660nm LEDs versus 450nm LEDs. It explains why red LEDs are breaking the 4 µmol/joule barrier, and white LEDs based on blue LEDs with a phosphor never will. Green LEDs are electrically inefficient and is a physics/semiconductor issue (our eyes are most sensitive to green light so we don't notice).

    *   **1240/wavelength of light in nanometers** = energy of a photon in eV (electron volts).

    *   **10.37/eV of photon** = µmol/joule or the maximum possible PPE (photosynthetic photon efficacy).

    *   _**Max possible PPE * LED efficiency** = the PPE for the specific LED_

    *   **Example:** 660nm photon. (1240/660=1.88eV) (10.37/1.88=5.52 µmol/joule). At 100% efficiency, a red 660nm LED would have a PPE of 5.52 µmol/joule.

    *   **Example:** 450nm photon. (1240/450=2.76eV) (10.37/2.76=3.76 µmol/joule). At 100% efficiency, a blue 450nm LED would have a PPE of 3.76 µmol/joule.

    *   **Question:** what is the electrical efficiency of a 660nm LED with a PPE of 2.8 µmol/joule? (1240/660=1.88eV) (10.37/1.88=5.52 µmol/joule) (2.8 µmol/joule/5.52 µmol/joule=50.7% efficient)

    *   **Question:** what is the electrical efficiency of a 450nm LED with a PPE of 2.8 µmol/joule? (1240/450=2.76eV) (10.37/2.76=3.76 µmol/joule) (2.8 µmol/joule/3.76 µmol/joule=74% efficient)"
