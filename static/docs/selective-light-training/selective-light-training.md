c: "SLT (Selective Light Training) is about _hitting certain parts of a plant with light for the purpose of light sensitive protein manipulation_ and their cascade affects through signal transduction pathways. A typical plant will have in excess of 1,000 light sensitive plant proteins.

It is all about targeted and selective light sensitive plant protein manipulation. The phot1 and phot2 [phototropin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phototropin) proteins are what's likely being manipulated with blue light. 


Blue causes plant cells to not elongate (as much) **so hitting the stem with blue gives a more compact plant**. Minus blue light can cause plant cells, such as found in leaves, to greatly expand. The problem is that with a minus blue only light source you'll also get massive stem elongation or some plants like sweet basil might not grow at all. _With selective light training you get the best of both worlds_ with something that will be low cost to mass produce.


I've been researching this for about 5 years now and enough information is provided here to build a set for non-commercial use. When the pending application is published you'd have this information regardless. **The patent is going to be granted for my work on the stem** only which is the most important aspect of Selective Light Training.

### Benefits of Selective Light Training

    </pre>

This technique _can be used with any type of light source_ for any propose, including genetically modified organism research, protein research, bonsai trees, industrial scale agriculture for early stage plant growth (such as apple/citrus/coffee/tea tree nurseries, etc). 


For industrial scale use, **SLT only needs to be used in the early stage of a plant's life** to get the benefits of early stage stem elongation reduction. This could allow for more productive root stocks to be used or to research on corn varieties which are useful to research the protein signal transduction pathways involved in optimizing its growth. For example, blue on the stem of one sweet corn variety caused early flowering.


For use on stems with small LED arrays, **you have to get the blue LED array up close to the stem with uninterrupted light** (that why I use 20x55 degree oval LEDs). 20 degrees side to side allows a little aiming slop and the 55 degrees vertical insures light overlap. 


The LEDs used can be found [here](http://ledz.com/?p=leds.oval) (use model number 725LB7C). **These are cheap Chinese LEDs so you need to under drive them to around 10 milliamps**. Putting 3 in series with a 330 ohm resistor and building an linear array allows for an unregulated, 12 volt power supply. All of this is to keep costs down (those LEDs are about 3 cents each out of China in quantity). I've never seen one of these blue LEDs burn out at the lower current levels. No, Christmas tree lights won't work. You need a certain intensity which is why the LEDs are so close together and a specific beam width is used.

### Plant species and SLT

 _Excess stem elongation is a thing of the past with most plants using this technique_ and you will get more growth per area or volume. For short day plants, use the light sticks for veg growth and the first two weeks of flowering only.

With blue light blasting the stem only, _other wavelengths of light can be used on the different parts of the plant_. Here's an example of sweet basil with blue on the stem and amber on the leaves which can be done in a greenhouse with amber or minus blue filters (full sunlight also means less growth due to [photorespiration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorespiration) - that's why shade cloths are often used). The leaves are [4 times larger than normal](http://i.imgur.com/e2dqQ.jpg) in a shorter plant. Here's an [8 inch tall pole bean](http://i.imgur.com/0j8DO.jpg) that would normally be 8 feet tall and what the [internodes](http://i.imgur.com/HZzCM.jpg) look like.  It's easy to test this for yourself.


Not all plants react the same and it is strain specific (sweet basil, lettuce leaf basil and purple basil react differently). Here's a [mystery skunk](http://i.imgur.com/9E8K3.jpg) giving to me where I can get 4-5 internodes per inch, even at lower main lighting levels. The red is [anthocyanin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthocyanin) build up, not a nutrient deficiency. 


Here's an example of using the light sticks with [intracanopy lighting](http://i.imgur.com/brrUX.jpg). Notice the fan. Here's what it looks like about with [3 weeks to go](http://i.imgur.com/0d5dy.jpg) also using intracanopy lighting. I've hit 3.4 ouces per square foot equivalent (this is 2/3rds of a square foot) in soil with this plant but while also using intracanopy lighting. **Being more compact with SLT makes intracanopy lighting more efficient**.


Here's [Purple Arrow](http://i.imgur.com/5NxrU.jpg) that had selective lighting training (it's a low yielding strain). This plant has not been topped and shows how different strains can give morphological differences. **The blue light on the stem tends to produce plants that are not as wide** but you have to test the strain to see how well SLT works for that strain. Once again, this allows more plants per area and more yield with intracanopy lighting. Intracanopy lighting often requires foliar nitrogen feeding and will produce a higher thermal load in your grow area as well as more humidity from the increased photosynthesis rate.


It is important to note that _you can not just use [blue side lighting](http://i.imgur.com/s71lQ.jpg) to pull this off_. The leaves tend to [grow downwards](http://i.imgur.com/ZUQpq.jpg) with blue side lighting blocking light from hitting the stem. **You must get the blue light in close to the stem** which is the difference between side lighting or intracanopy lighting and selective light training.


Also, I should point out that the blue LEDs only need to be used on the growing parts of a plant (zone of division and zone of elongation). I've tested this with hardwoods, like Fuji Apple on a P-22 rootstock, and it does work for making more compact grafts as long as you hit the growing part of a hardwood before the bark has formed. More compact apple trees means more productive root stocks may be used. Coffee is usually cut back to six feet or so each year. **More lower branching from SLT could mean higher yields**. If should also allow new bonsai tree techniques. There's a whole lot of testing yet to be done!"
