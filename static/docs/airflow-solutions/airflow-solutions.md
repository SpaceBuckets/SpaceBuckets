In this section we review good ventilation solutions that you can use for cooling your always trusty bucket garden.

    ### 110/220v fans

    These fans are a step up from standard PC fans, as they run at line voltage (110v or 220v, depending on where you live). **This cooling solution is sturdy and reliable**, protected with a metal frame. Most of these fans also come wired with a plug for easy installation in the garden. A typical 110v fan works at about 50CFM, with a noise level of 40dBA. **These units have 40% more airflow than PC fans**, which makes them a good choice for cooling small spaces (and also for DIY carbon filters such as this one).

    ### 12v PC fans

    This is a basic and cheap solution for ventilation and cooling in Space Buckets. **PC fans are easy to find and recycle, and they provide enough airflow** to extract the heat from your garden. Keep in mind that in order to run PC fans you need a 12v power supply, which are also cheap and readily available. With 1A you can run 2 fans safely, though your mileage may vary and testing is always recommended. A typical 12v PC fan works at about 30 CFM (Cubic Feet per Minute) with a noise level of 26 dBA. These are usually not b enough to handle carbon filters.

    ### Booster fans

    Duct fans are a great (and often overlooked) alternative for cooling Space Buckets, as they provide good airflow: the 4' version provides about 100 CFM, which is 70% more than standard PC fans. **These Booster fans can be used in high temperature situations** to extract the heat from the bulbs. These fans also work at line voltage (110v or 220v), and they come already wired with a plug, so installation is a matter of fitting it in the bucket and turning it on. They're a cheaper kind of inline fan, which can be used for odor carbon filtering.

    ### USB fans

    Most cheap USB fans are built with brushed rather than brushless motors and are not likely to last more than a few months (see this comparison thread). However there are some higher end USB fans (for example the Stylepie Fun Fun Fan) that are brushless and will last a long time. A sewn carbon filter can be put on this fan but its ability to push enough air through is debatable."
