c: "<p>Power supplies have historically been the weak link in an LED grow light system and <b>cheap capacitors are the main issue</b>. The cheap boost converters you can buy on Amazon and eBay will work, but don't expect more than about 6 months use out of them. Again, it's the capacitors that tend to fail.</p>

    <div>XLG Series Mean Well Power Supply</div>
</div>

<p>Get a Mean Well LED driver for your DIY projects.<b><a href='https://amzn.to/3sYoSeH'>The XLG series</a> are constant power and work quite well with a Vero 18 or 29.</b> The nice thing about that configuraion is that a Vero 18 or 29 can be quickly interchanged at the same power level so you can rapidly measure the differences between the two if needed.</p>

<p><strong>External LED drivers keep you off line voltage</strong> which is the compelling reason to use them for DIY use. The better ones are <a href='https://www.pcscsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ULversusUR_PCSC.pdf'>'UR' marked</a>, with a reverse 'UR', which means it has been tested for safety for a factory install component of an electrical device (as opposed to a UL marking for a field install of a complete electrical device although there are plenty of ANSI/UL 8750 listed LED drivers).</p>

<p>I often use <a href='https://amzn.to/2WAllHI'>lab power supplies</a> as my LED drivers. If you only get one lab power supply make sure it's a linear power supply and not a noisy switching power supply. <b>Lower cost linear power supplies typically have a fan</b> that will turn on at certain current levels while more expensive and much heavier ones are entirely passive cooled.</p>"
