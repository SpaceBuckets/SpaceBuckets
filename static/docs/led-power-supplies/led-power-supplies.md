The cheap boost converters you can buy on Amazon and eBay will work, but don't expect more than about 6 months use out of them. Again, it's the capacitors that tend to fail.

    </pre>

    Get a Mean Well LED driver for your DIY projects. **[The XLG series](https://amzn.to/3sYoSeH) are constant power and work quite well with a Vero 18 or 29.** The nice thing about that configuraion is that a Vero 18 or 29 can be quickly interchanged at the same power level so you can rapidly measure the differences between the two if needed.


    _External LED drivers keep you off line voltage_ which is the compelling reason to use them for DIY use. The better ones are ['UR' marked](https://www.pcscsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ULversusUR_PCSC.pdf), with a reverse 'UR', which means it has been tested for safety for a factory install component of an electrical device (as opposed to a UL marking for a field install of a complete electrical device although there are plenty of ANSI/UL 8750 listed LED drivers).


    I often use [lab power supplies](https://amzn.to/2WAllHI) as my LED drivers. If you only get one lab power supply make sure it's a linear power supply and not a noisy switching power supply. **Lower cost linear power supplies typically have a fan** that will turn on at certain current levels while more expensive and much heavier ones are entirely passive cooled."
