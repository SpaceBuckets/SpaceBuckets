_Blue light decreases [acid growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_growth)_ (which is different than growth through photosynthesis). Excess acid growth, or 'stretching', in seedlings/veg is all about greater cell expansion in the stem that we get from **lower lighting levels or not enough blue light**. We typically only want as much blue in a light source to help prevent any excess stem elongation. Blue photons have much more energy needed for photosynthesis, and **this extra energy is wasted as heat that the plant has to dissipate**. The associated blue light sensitive proteins are the [phototropins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phototropin) and [cryptochromes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptochrome).

    ### GREEN

    In healthy cannabis, _80-90% of green light is being absorbed and available for photosynthesis_. Green is the opposite of blue in photomorphogenesis responses in that green causes stretching also called the [shade avoidance responses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shade_avoidance). **Pretty much anything blue does, green does the opposite**. Green can help make leaves larger and increase the LAI (leaf area index) for greater light capture. **Green LEDs are relatively electrically inefficient** which is why they are not commonly used in grow lights. In physics/engineering this is known as the green gap (graph). We do, however, perceive green light much higher than red or blue light, so for display purposes this inefficiency matters less.

    ### RED & FAR RED

    For photomorphogenesis responses, red and far red are opposites like blue and green are opposites. _Red can help keep a plant more compact_ but not nearly to the degree of blue. The associated red/far red light sensitive proteins are the [phytochromes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytochrome). Red photons have a lower energy with a higher theoretical PPE of about 5.51 uMol/joule (660nm) compared to blue of 3.76 uMol/joule (450nm). The higher efficacy is **one reason why red LEDs are being added to white LEDs**: what's held them back is their electrical efficiency (red and blue LEDs use different semiconductor material).


    _Far red causes greater stretching_ like green light and contributes to the shade avoidance responses. It 'may' help put short day plants 'to sleep' faster. Far red may in some plants **may be able to drive photosynthesis efficiently** though the Emerson enhancement effect. About 50% of far red light is reflected off plant leaves, and also transmits easily though leaves.

    ### UV

    _Ultraviolet is a wild card_ and I can make no rhyme or reason of it working with a variety of plants. **It tends to cause dwarfing** when used as an only light source (UVA). For cannabis, the idea is to try to increase trichome and THC levels by adding UV, but some researchers including [Bruce Bugbee are saying this does not happen](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/paoigz/im_dr_bruce_bugbee_professor_of_crop_physiology/ha6jc88/?context=3). The only identified UV protein is the [UVR8 protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UVR8), **which is only UVB sensitive, not UVA sensitive** (285nm peak sensitivity).
