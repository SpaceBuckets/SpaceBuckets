c: "<h3>BLUE</h3>
<p><strong>Blue light decreases <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_growth'>acid growth</a></strong> (which is different than growth through photosynthesis). Excess acid growth, or 'stretching', in seedlings/veg is all about greater cell expansion in the stem that we get from <b>lower lighting levels or not enough blue light</b>. We typically only want as much blue in a light source to help prevent any excess stem elongation. Blue photons have much more energy needed for photosynthesis, and <b>this extra energy is wasted as heat that the plant has to dissipate</b>. The associated blue light sensitive proteins are the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phototropin'>phototropins</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptochrome'>cryptochromes</a>.</p>

<h3>GREEN</h3>
<p>In healthy cannabis, <strong>80-90% of green light is being absorbed and available for photosynthesis</strong>. Green is the opposite of blue in photomorphogenesis responses in that green causes stretching also called the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shade_avoidance'>shade avoidance responses</a>. <b>Pretty much anything blue does, green does the opposite</b>. Green can help make leaves larger and increase the LAI (leaf area index) for greater light capture. <b>Green LEDs are relatively electrically inefficient</b> which is why they are not commonly used in grow lights. In physics/engineering this is known as the green gap (graph). We do, however, perceive green light much higher than red or blue light, so for display purposes this inefficiency matters less.</p>

<h3>RED & FAR RED</h3>
<p>For photomorphogenesis responses, red and far red are opposites like blue and green are opposites. <strong>Red can help keep a plant more compact</strong> but not nearly to the degree of blue. The associated red/far red light sensitive proteins are the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytochrome'>phytochromes</a>. Red photons have a lower energy with a higher theoretical PPE of about 5.51 uMol/joule (660nm) compared to blue of 3.76 uMol/joule (450nm). The higher efficacy is <b>one reason why red LEDs are being added to white LEDs</b>: what's held them back is their electrical efficiency (red and blue LEDs use different semiconductor material).</p>
<p><strong>Far red causes greater stretching</strong> like green light and contributes to the shade avoidance responses. It 'may' help put short day plants 'to sleep' faster. Far red may in some plants <b>may be able to drive photosynthesis efficiently</b> though the Emerson enhancement effect. About 50% of far red light is reflected off plant leaves, and also transmits easily though leaves.</p>

<h3>UV</h3>
<strong>Ultraviolet is a wild card</strong> and I can make no rhyme or reason of it working with a variety of plants. <b>It tends to cause dwarfing</b> when used as an only light source (UVA). For cannabis, the idea is to try to increase trichome and THC levels by adding UV, but some researchers including <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/paoigz/im_dr_bruce_bugbee_professor_of_crop_physiology/ha6jc88/?context=3'>Bruce Bugbee are saying this does not happen</a>. The only identified UV protein is the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UVR8'>UVR8 protein</a>, <b>which is only UVB sensitive, not UVA sensitive</b> (285nm peak sensitivity). </p>
