Lux meters in general should only be used for white light, not mixed/monochromatic light sources (for example, 660nm red LED, 440nm blue LED). Be sure to always measure from the top of the canopy.


    These measurements correspond to a **white light LED CRI 80** (in this case 70 lux is equal to 1 Âµmol/m2/sec):

    *   **5,000 lux** = unrooted cuttings (you don't want too much light)

    *   **15,000 lux** = lower end for seedlings (common microgreen level)

    *   **25,000 lux** = lower end for vegetative growth

    *   **40,000 lux** = lower end for flowering

    *   **75,000 lux** = this starts to hit light saturation


    _These values is only valid for white light._ Except for unrooted cuttings, you want to stay above these numbers. I've grown seedlings fine at 35klx, and many people on [the /r/SpaceBuckets subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/SpaceBuckets/) are running their plants at >75klk or equivalent. **You really want to stay above 40klx for flowering, and many professionals are going to be closer to 75-90klx**. I tend to grow plants at higher lighting levels myself. As a general rule, if your seedlings are 'stretching' then you need more total light or a higher color temperature light."
