This is my first space bucket after being a long time lurker. I have decided to grow cherry tomatoes until cannabis is legalized for growing where I live. My set up is a 32 gallon brute with a MarsHydro 300w LED, 2 120V high speed fans by AC infinity for intake near the bottom and a 4 in 190 CFM fan with carbon filter from IPower for exhaust near to top. I have <a href='https://amzn.to/30TZOZn'>5630SMD LED</a> 12V tape lights wrapped around the interior near the bottom. Both lights are connected to a dual outlet timer, whilst the exhaust fan has a speed adjuster put on low. This creates a strong enough pull that allows me to unplug both intake fans and have them still spin and blow air into the bucket, which helps save on electricity. I cut fabric and placed it onto the lid to help prevent light leaks, along with black UV duct tape. I used HVAC tape for reflectivity. A Walgreens humidifier was placed on the exterior near one of the intake fans to help regulate the humidity. I have a hydrometer + temp reader that stays in the bucket as well. I cut out a door so I can water and check out the plant’s progress without lifting up the lid and or taking the plant out completely.

Big shout out to /u/ticklemyelm0! <strong>I basically used his post as my main foundation.</strong> Now with that said the materials are four 5 gallon buckets from Home Depot, a <a href='http://amzn.to/21jnEWN'>180w UFO LED light</a> (and <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BPIWY28/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BPIWY28&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=spacbuck-20'>5050SMD side-lighting</a>), plus a 240 CFM duct fan.

One thing that is different on this than others I have seen on the site is that others place a row of screws around the drain pan to keep the main bucket elevated out of the bottom of the pan. Instead of a row of screws, I used a section from the middle of the bucket which I cut a vertical slit in, and just placed it in the drain pan. Another thing that I noticed was that I place my plants into a 3 gallon fabric bag (A little tight, so I’ll probably use a slightly smaller fabric bag in the future) which fits down inside the main bucket (to make it easy to remove the plants if necessary), and I realized that a 5 gallon bucket wasn’t deep enough since the top of the fabric bag was higher than my intake fans. I needed the top of the bag to be just below the intake fans. So I extended the main bucket by about 4 inches (8 inches from bottom of a bucket and taped the extension to the main bucket with 4 inches of overlap). I also covered each seam and edge where Mylar was used with foil tape, which should provide less problems down the road. <h3>First Bucket</h3> Drill 1 1/2 inch holes in bottom of bucket for lamp holders. One in center and other 2 approx 2 1/2 inches from center on straight line. Cut bottom of bucket out approx 1 inch from edge. This will be referred to as light spacer. Cut remainder of bucket bottom off bucket. This will be the Main bucket. Cut holes for side fans about 1/2 inch below protrusion of bucket. <h3>Second Bucket</h3> Cut bucket approx 8 inch from bottom. Drill some 1/2 holes in the bottom of bucket for drainage. (Bottom part used for extension of main bucket, Top Part will be a bucket spacer) <h3>Third Bucket</h3> Cut bucket approx 8 inch from bottom. Cut approx 2 1/2 inch from the top of the 8 inch piece that you just cut off, and cut a vertical slit so it can be easily coiled into the drain pan. (The remaining 5 1/2 bottom will be the drain pan, the 2 1/2 piece will be a drainage spacer to place in the drain pan to keep the main bucket raised, The remaining top piece will be a bucket spacer) <h3>Fourth Bucket</h3> Cut bucket approx 4 inch from bottom. (Top part will be housing for lighting. Bottom part can be used as temp drain pan when you are removing the main bucket from the 'actual' drain pan when you need to empty the 'actual' drain pan) <h3>Bucket Lid</h3> Cut round holes for fan exhaust. (Mark outside of fan, and find appropriate size can to mark circle in center) Place the bottom that you cutout from the first bucket (Light Spacer) in the center of the lid and drill 4 holes to mount to the lid. (when drilling the holes they should be at least a 1/2 inch away from the protrusion on the lid, so the flat washers will sit flat) Position the Light Spacer so the 3 holes you drilled for the Lamp Holders are at a 90 degree angle to the fan holes you just cut. (4 screws will be used to mount and space from the lid. Put screws in as you go to hold in position). Position fans and drill mounting holes. (Inside 2 holes for each fan will be in the light holder area) Drill the holes that are thru the Light Spacer out to 1/2 inch to allow access to the fan mounting nuts later (in case you have to replace a fan) There is probably a protrusion on the top of the lid that you will need to cut away to allow the fan to sit flat. <h3>Assembly</h3> BUCKET TOP Take bucket top and secure fans with screws, with fan air direction being up and away from bucket. Place 4 screws with flat washers on inside and out and secure with nuts. Position power strip and drill small holes either side of cord and both sides about 1 inch from bottom and secure with wire ties. Cover the bottom of the light spacer with Mylar. After adhesive has dried, cut Mylar away from holes. And install lamp holders. Drill small hole in bucket top for electrical cord. Cut female end from extension cord off, push through hole and make wiring connections to the light sockets.

Greetings from South America. It's an honor to be part of this community of learners, of tinkerers. I do believe in the free flow of ideas and the unparalleled power of the Internet. I've heard about space buckets a white ago, but since I've decided to try to grow indoor medicine my interest sparkled and coincidence or not, HighTimes Magazine publishes an article on how to build your own space bucket on December 2017 presenting some of its history and a few designs. What caught my attention was the DYI philosophy and the 'quasi-anarquist' attitude to make it work independently of space, structure, costs and labour. When I saw the next article from HighTimes in January 2018 it was it, this article presented 6 sickest space bucket designs and The Space Tote V3 by /u/spacetotebuilder completely caught me thinking, this one is the one I want to build and try. So I've decided to give this build a chance, so my own design is inspired by Space Tote V3. I've started buying the LED panel, 5m of LED Strip, mylar film and the humidity and temperature monitor from Amazon. Next step I've made a visit to local electronics super cheap market in my town to find the rest of the materials, such as 4 computer fans, electric outlet, 2 x 12V 5A power adapters, one for the LED Strip and the other for the computer fans (the fans keep on 24/7) and the LED strip follows the light schedule and the timer for the lights. Another visit to local hardware store and bought 2 hinges, screws and 2 rectangular trash cans to use as totes to create my grow environment.\nThe 2 bottom fans intake air to the environment and the top 2 fans exhaust it. I've chosen this not so wide trash cans for it's height and cheap price. Proper totes are expensive in our country. Maybe I'll upgrade to bigger totes as soon as I find some 90+liters sturdy totes for a cheap price. Right now only found it expensive ones.\nMy first seedling test is already growing fast and its good. If I notice dust being pulled inside, I'll add a light and thin net screen to intake fans to help avoid dust.\nI hope this could inspire another bucketeer to build and have great harvest and change this world little by little to a better place.

The goal is to keep the riser and sprinkler head just under the bucket so the spray will hit all the nets. Measure accordingly and cut the riser to fit. Assemble the water pump, riser, and sprinkler head once measurements and cuts are complete. Then fill the Bucket with water so it covers the water pump then stand back and plug it in to see how the water flows inside the Bucket. Note: do this test outside or keep a mop handy. <strong>Once the water pump assembly is complete, empty the Bucket of water.</strong> Place the Bucket Lid with the 1 7/8' holes cut into it on top of the Bucket and check where to make a small notch for the water pump cord. Note how in the pictures it is placed towards the back; this assists me in placement when it comes time to determine which clones are in what position.Cut out a small notch for the power cord and test fit. I wanted it snug so water would not have an avenue for escape by cutting it too large or wide. Take a zip-tie and secure the power cord with a small loop to the Bucket.

Depending on the ambient room temperature the temperatures will go higher(80-87F) when I attach to the ducting/carbon filter to the fan. I put an air conditioner into the room where I keep it, it helps to control the temperatures while also completely covering up the sound of the fan even when it's out in the open.

Holes in the lid, <a href='http://amzn.to/1YlxtRS'>3x20w warm white LED bulbs</a>, 5 meters of <a href='http://amzn.to/1S9nZup'>5050SMD LEDs</a>, PVC elbows for light traos, and a small PC fan (6cm).

Once the power strip is secured in place, poke a hole about an inch in diameter for the power strip's plug and cable to fit through and pull them through. I also plugged the LED power supply into that same power strip so all the lights go on and off at once - feed the power plug for the LED power supply through the same hole as the power strip's plug so everything's organized. Open the lid and find where the intake fan is. Choose one of the top corners of the fan hole and place the plug end of the LED strip at that corner, that's where the power plug will travel outside the bucket to plug in. When you start laying down the LED strip, spiral it upwards, not downwards. If you go downwards, you'll go over the fan. You should only be able to fit about 2-3 full coils out of a 5m strip inside a 32 gallon barrel. I ordered two LED strips, I may install the second one if temps are low or something. <h3>REFLECTIVE LINING</h3> This was a pain in the ass. Mylar emergency blankets are really light and easy to crumple, so you gotta take this part slow to avoid tearing the blanket unnecessarily. With the lid off, start placing down strips of double-sided tape all along the inside walls. You don't need to cover every single square inch, just make sure the lining will stay up. Also, the mylar doesn't need to be perfectly flat when it's installed...if you can make it work, godspeed...but after 15 min of trying to figure it out, I just crudely taped up the lining in all its imperfection and it works well enough. I also placed a small sheet of mylar on the bottom of the barrel. <h3>FINAL TOUCHES</h3> Once everything is in place, secure the fans and wire them together along with a length of electrical wire. Connect all the fans to that length of electrical wire so you only need one plug to turn them all on. When all is said and done, you'll only need to plug in the power strip and the fan power supply, two outlets max (less if you use a second power strip!). Use your best cable management skills if you so desire, it makes everything look a lot cleaner!","v":"2915","g":"bin,cfl,pcfan","z":"","i":[{"h":"1-2.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"2-2.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"3-2.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"4-2.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"5-1.jpg","s":"100"}]},{"t":"EGGPLANT'S UFO BUILD","s":"DebaucherousEggplant","a":"DebaucherousEggplant","d":"2015-03-26","c":"Hey all! <strong>I'm so close to starting my first bucket grow</strong>.

It uses 100 Epistar 3W LEDS, and has two 34V 1.5A drivers inside and two fans. I reversed fans so that the light draws the air from the bucket and pushes it out on top. For the walls I'm using one 5050SMD 5m 12v LED strip that goes around the top bucket. This one is good because it doesn't need a special driver and you can simply connect it to the 12v power supply. I installed an Arduino Uno with a 4 relay shield, RTC module and 16x2 LCD. I use Arduino to switch the lights on and off through relays. The RTC module simply keeps the time so that the Arduino gets the current time when I switch the bucket off and on. And I use LCD just to make sure that the system has the correct time. I've also used the Arduino soldering shield to solder all the wires so that I can take the top bucket off without disconnecting anything. I've mounted the 12V power supply directly onto the bucket and connected the Arduino GND and Vin to one of the 12v outputs. The fan is using this output as well. I run it 24/7. The other output is used by the LED strip where one wire is connected directly and the other is going through the relay. The relays are controlled by the couple of digital outputs on Arduino through the Alarm library. I don't have the code to share atm unfortunately.

I'm in the phase now of testing temperature and humidity, photoperiod cycles, and the irrigation system. <strong>Everything is working as expected!</strong> The bucket has 4 intake openings for airflow, transmitter for temperature and humidity, irrigation system using PVC pipes and also a 7L airpot.The pot is inside a cut out bottom of a bucket about 2 inches tall to catch any runoff water. The plan is to leave it there to keep the humidity about 50-70% inside the bucket. If it goes higher then that water can be drained very easily. <h3>PLANT FOOD</h3> Regarding nutrients. I bought <a href='http://amzn.to/1Lk0Ik5'>FoxFarm nutes</a> that I'm planning to use depending on the stage I'm in (vegetative vs flowering). With these nutrients you prepare the mix with water and then you irrigate. You need to control the pH before adding any nutrients (it should be between 6.5 and 6.8) and once they are added you have to control the EC (electrical conductivity), this one depends on the stage (it should be around 0.9 during the vegetative stage and between 1.5 and 2.0 during flowering). You don't add any nutrients during the germination and seedling stages and during these stages the pH should be between 6.5 and 6.8 and the EC should be around 0.4. <h3>WATERING STUFF</h3><strong>The irrigation system is very simple</strong>, it uses PVC pipes to go from the outside into the inside of the bucket and it contains a valve that can be used to control the flow of the water. So, I pour the water into the bottle, it goes down the hose, and it's then evenly dispersed by the PVC pipes, these PVC pipes have holes in them  and it goes around the stem of the plant to get water everywhere. <strong>I just wanted to look as clean as possible, and I'm happy with the results.</strong> I'm sure I'll have to do adjustments during the next months but nothing major I hope.","v":"15967","g":"5050,pcfan,ufo,ufo180","e":"gallery,supersized,gallery,ufo bucket","z":"","i":[{"h":"1.jpg","s":"66.4"},{"h":"2.jpg","s":"66.4"},{"h":"4.jpg","s":"66.4"},{"h":"a17.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"b15.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"c1.jpg","s":"106.4"},{"h":"e12.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"f.jpg","s":"94.7"}]},{"t":"F4NBOY BUILD","s":"f4nboy","a":"F4nboy","d":"2017-11-19","c":"This is my SB v2.0 build!

With so many different examples I was actually quite excited to start. This is my first bucket it's not the cheap option, but I liked what I have done.I have to start a 210 litre water butt sliced around the top to ease access when needed. I chose this size to allow my plants so good spreading space and leave me some room for lst. The main lights are 3x50 Watt, I bought 9 of these for my cabinet, never got around to using them (see above) It was a no brainer to use them they also include 6 UV and 6 IR leds per bulb. The originally hung from the lid and the exhaust fans we're built into the lid also, I then realised with them hanging I had minimal grow room, so I added the 'hat' which gave me an extra 18inches. The light pendant is on a yo-yo lead so I can lower the he light with minimal effort.I have 3x 5m lengths of side lights  1x warm, 1x cool and 1x pure white. This was not the plan, but I ordered a replacement strip as a pure white thinking it was the same, which it isn't and next bucket I build will have pure white instead as they appear to be a lot better. Unsure of the wavelength though. All leds are wired into a single transformer I wanted a clean look without wire hanging everywhere.I coated the inside with diamond Mylar and foil tape. This stuff has some good read ups however it's a pig to stick the leds to, hence the white tape that is holding them up also.Fans are 2x 92mm inlet and 2x 120mm exhaust, each has it's own speed control. The exhaust fans are easily unplugged which on some days I have to as they are too powerful really and suck the humidity out. I bought the fans without doing the math first. I staggered the inlet fans to hopefully create some kind of circulation inside the bucket. All electrics run off a single 4 gang lead which is surge protected also for a clean and tidy look.I am currently making a filter to attach to the exhaust fans directly, with a bathroom extractor fan to help. Just waiting on more carbon to be delivered. Also an irrigation pipe will also be built in at some point. Pictures of these will follow.I've now added the filter, it has all but eliminated any odour present, no more waking up with the munchies.The top pot has around 2kg of large activated charcoal chunks and a sweet jar drilled with inch holes and covered with a stocking. An extractor fan is taped to this to pull the air through the charcoal. The ducting just slips over the exhaust fans of the bucket which I have turned up to around half speed. The humidity and temperature have hardly changed but can all be tuned via the speed controllers. The filter can easily be disconnected and moved for internal work or there is enough ducting to move the filter, to the floor or shelf.THINGS I'VE LEARNT Diamond Mylar is great,  but things don't stick to it so next time I'll use cable ties to fix the led strips to the inside. I would also wire these properly outside and then route them inside, as I had a slight burn out on one strip where I just twisted the wires together although all the joints were taped and insulated Aluminium tape is great. The most annoying thing I've learnt is to do with the 12v transformer. It's a 30amp model (running 3x 5m lcompensate and 4 fans)  and has a cooling fan. These apparently don't like standing up as it affects the fan which makes them very noisy and now after laying it down the fan just grinds away,  I'll be replacing this at some point and rejigging the side box to compensate. I've used too much fan really even at the lowest speed I have low humidity levels and have to unplug one exhaust fan and add a humidifier during veg, this fires in through the highest intake fan from outside so no real issues.  Fleabay special,  3litre humidifier shipped from China cost less than £5, lasts all day,  easy fix...  However lowering the humidity is a piece of cake. Next project will be totes I think.

We used the Roledro 300w UFO LED light cut in the top, and have since added two sets of LEDMO LED strip lights (3000k) around the top of the bottom bin for better all around lighting. We have two Silenx fans for input and exhaust. They seem to work well, although in retrospect, we should have had the bulk of the fan outside of the bucket. This set comes with a transformer with a speed knob to adjust the fan speed as needed with 5 total plug ins for additional fans. We haven’t light proofed it, but will have an external case for the whole setup when bloom comes (e.g., a light proofed cardboard box case that we can just cover the whole thing unless we need in). Seems easier than fighting leaks. We cut a hole in the side of the top bin and secured it with Velcro so we can peek without taking the whole top off. We’ve also moved the plants way closer to the light for the time being.

It is overly complicated, and I'll probably kill the plant with it - <strong>but I had FUN making it!</strong> I'm using a 5 gallon black bucket for a reservoir, plus a 20 gallon bucket for the main container. A lot of this was stuff I already had, so I really didn't spend much. As you might have noticed, there is no RTC on the Arduino so right now the lights are running from the relay to a regular light timer. After I get a better light top built I'd like to add an RTC and some data logging capability to the Arduino. <strong>I'll eventually put it all on a real circuit board. Crawl before you walk, right?</strong><h3>THE LIGHTS</h3> So these were salvaged from a light bar I built a long time ago for something else. This light hood is temporary until I have time to build a better one.<strong> The LEDs are Vero 13, in parallel.</strong> Kind of a no-no wiring wise, but they do all have fuses on them. These chips were binned pretty well, too. The current is nearly equal to all as is. Like I said, temporary.<strong> About 100w of 4000k led.</strong> 12v supply, <a href='http://amzn.to/1LYGNWY'>Arduino</a>, L7805 regulator, ULN2803 for powering. Bottom row of LED's indicate the relays. The 7 segment displays the sensor data: water temp, air temp, humidity, and fan speed. The button cycles the values. The top row indicates which is showing at the moment. <h3>UPDATE</h3> After the first week using this setup, a number of problems with the controller have become apparent. <strong>The first big flaw is not having data logging.</strong> Using the arduino as a readout for sensors is kinda pointless when you can buy a $15 device from HD that can do that already. The other big flaw is not having external environment sensors, without this the controller can never really know where the optimal settings for ventilation are. If your bucket is inside, this wouldn't be much of an issue but mine is outside where the environment is constantly changing. So I'm skipping the new light top and redoing the controller first. <strong>I've moved from the Uno to the pro mini platform</strong>, added an RTC, added SD card for logging, and swapped out the 7 segment + LED's for an I2C display to free up some pins on the ardunio.","v":"12136","g":"arduino,brute,custom","e":"gallery,articles,resources,led ideas","z":"","i":[{"h":"1.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"2.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"3.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"a.jpg","s":"75"},{"h":"AwLghsi.jpg","s":"75"},{"h":"b.jpg","s":"75"},{"h":"c.jpg","s":"75"},{"h":"IRHWLHi.jpg","s":"75"},{"h":"JxbQBCA.jpg","s":"75"},{"h":"jZ7RZSr.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"O7kainN.jpg","s":"75"},{"h":"OhiQ5tK.jpg","s":"75"},{"h":"WPOu998.jpg","s":"75"},{"h":"Yd9aVu6.jpg","s":"75"}]},{"t":"haribo STARMIX","s":"haribo-starmix","a":"","d":"2018-12-30","c":"My haribo starmix Bucket took me a few days to plan and about 8 hrs in total to build total cost was about£10.00 really pleased with how it turned out","v":"366","g":"","z":"","i":[{"h":"znUDTEq.jpg","s":"161"}]},{"t":"THE WALRUS BUCKET","s":"has_a_bucket","a":"has_a_bucket","d":"2015-06-09","c":"Hi team!

Thermal grease was added to improve thermal conduction. The chinese LEDs are not driven at 100W but kept at about 50-70W. That also makes thermal management easier. As for the general supply of energy: the 360W driver brings the voltage down from 230/120V down to 30V. From there two small buck converter bring it further down to 5V (microcontroller) and 12V (fans and maybe later LED strip). For the LEDs there's the 150W boost converter to bring the voltage up again to in between 30 and 36V, thus controlling the output power.The chip controls the on-off-times of the LEDs (18/6 and 12/12), regulates the cooling of heatsink and air inside the barrel, and it can also output the sensor values of sink and air temperature as well as humidity. The lights can also be switched on and off manually and of course the user switches from veg to flower.<h3>HYDROPONIC STUFF</h3>The lower part of the barrel is filled with 15-20l of nutrient solution. The solution is oxygenated by the aquarium air pump, then the solution is top-fed to the plant 24/7 the first couple of weeks (to promote faster growth). A ball valve allows for easy filling and draining. After that a disk out of thick plastic makes the floor which the mesh pot sits in. On that level there's also the air intake which at the moment creates positive pressure, but once I flower in there it will be fixed to the air outlet to create negative pressure. That air will then be pushed through activated carbon.","v":"12779","g":"barrel,custom,pcfan","z":"","i":[{"h":"1-6.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"10.jpg","s":"75"},{"h":"2-6.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"3-6.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"4-6.jpg","s":"75"},{"h":"5-5.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"6-4.jpg","s":"75"},{"h":"7.jpg","s":"75"},{"h":"8.jpg","s":"75"},{"h":"9.jpg","s":"75"}]},{"t":"Hydroponic-bucket","s":"hydroponic-bucket","a":"","d":"2017-03-15","c":"Four 60w bulbs, A 120 led, 2 totes and 1 bucket hydro","v":"1669","g":"pcfan,tote,ufo300","z":"","i":[{"h":"DbPhQP4.jpg","s":"133.3"},{"h":"Q7F4ela.jpg","s":"133.3"},{"h":"qVDQs32.jpg","s":"133.3"},{"h":"RKKqKAA.jpg","s":"133.3"}]},{"t":"HYROERO'S LOTUS","s":"Hyroero","a":"hyroero","d":"2017-01-24","c":"Got a <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>UFO LED light</a> <strong>powered at ~135w</strong>.

By using <a href='https://amzn.to/3lyKIRa'>LED bulbs</a>instead of CFLs, I can get away with using a USB cabled laptop cooling pad ($12cdn) as the fan, installed in the top, facilitating rising warm air to escape. I haven't used a themometer as of yet, but the temperature stays pretty even and the plants seem happy. I have 2 small additional USB fans I found, but haven't felt the need to add them. The entire thing runs on 64watts (equivalent to just over 1 standard lightbulb) or less (power used for USB laptop cooling pad couldn't be determined, so I went with the highest estimate I could fnd). This is really good for anyone who has a landlord who keeps a strict eye on your hydro usage! I am going to upgrade to 100w LED daylights, (using 60watt daylight LED bulbs currently), as soon as a store near me stocks them, but I also wanted to complete one full cycle with the bare minimum just to see what the end result will be.

I bought 2 worklights (on sale for $12/ea), 2 light adapters $3/ea, 1 laptop cooling pad fan $12, I had the totes laying around and the duct tape was the most costly item of the whole build. I added velcro around the fan so a dryer sheet could be attached to help cover the smell. I also had some left-over red reflector stickers and figured why not, couldn't hurt, lol. Drilled holes in the bottom and laid down cut pieces of plant container drying pads to increase air circulation from below after removing the container bottoms, which I stacked in the centre and covered in foil to reflect light upwards. Inside divider, top half and the lid are all separate pieces that are removeble for easy access.

The camper is warm and cozy but as heat rises and our heat source is a wallmount heater, you sweat from your chest up, and everything below is a cool 55° or so.. this said I had to change a few things about my bucket. It has 2 12v fans from an old power inverter that came with my camper, and 1 120v fan from an old heater I torn apart.. My light head bucket is made up of 2 full spectrum 60w <a href='https://amzn.to/3lyKIRa'>LED bulbs</a> from Walmart, and 1x40w <a href='https://amzn.to/3jMfTYw'>CFL bulbs</a> that I had in a drawer. I also found 2 more buckets along the way.. I used aluminum tape for the interior of the bucket, and cut everything with my big Bowie knife. Between hunting up free parts, and replanning my design about 7 times, I finally made a deduction as to how I am going to build.. So far I only have 3 day old sprouts in it but looks like it is working really well.. This is a project that will never be finished, and I plan on using red and blue <a href='https://amzn.to/30TZOZn'>5630SMD LED</a> strips around the entire interior of my center 2 buckets that house the 12v fans, and adding about 3 more <a href='https://amzn.to/3jMfTYw'>CFL bulbs</a> to the head when plant is closer to bloom. This is my first bucket, and second ever attempt at growing this type of plant. Everybody reading this is along in a journey with me.. I can't wait to see what the bucket turns into, and how well the plant turns out..  Total cost of build : $20  Total time to build : just about a full day off and on taking my time. I will post more pictures as I go, I hope it helps inspire your own ideas! Or completely copy mine.. just run the fans in the same direction as my blueprint..

It has taken only several months, but I'm super happy with the way it has turned out. It has been a blast to plan, work out some interesting solutions and build. I think for the most part, this bucket is complete... save for some tweaks. Lots of lessons were learned and lots of things I would do differently however, that is probably best left for Bucket #2 (and that begins with <a href='/u/3Drenders'>more 3D models!</a>). The truth: many design decisions came down to 'would this look badass?'<ol><li>Yes -&gt; hell yeah!</li><li>No -&gt; how can one make this look more awesome?</li></ol> <h3>LIGHTING CONFIGURATION</h3> The lights are 4x 100w eBay warm white LEDs running at 30W each. Thermal switches are mounted on the back of the heatsinks. Discussion for mounting considerations, assembly of hardware, placement and justification can be found in <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceBuckets/comments/3dc9et/drill_press_is_my_homie/'>here</a> and <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceBuckets/comments/3ehzpk/this_has_taken_far_longer_than_i_anticipated_but/'>here</a>. They are housed inside a 2.5-Gal bucket. The idea is to follow <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>UFO LED light</a> in function. <a href='https://i.imgur.com/qWVuBn6.jpg'>I think this image is most illustrative</a>. Air is drawn through the bucket, through the heatsinks and expelled by the exhaust ducted to the top. This also cools the drivers which are mounted on top of the heatsink. A 10-inch pan lid is used to make the reflector. I cut the holes with a hole saw... <a href='http://liandri.beyondunreal.com/w/images/Ut_w6.jpg' type='IMAGE' name='img12'>it was an adventure.</a><strong>Bonus:</strong> The light-top assembly is modular and can be plopped onto other types of enclosures like Brute buckets!I'm also using 5 meters of warm white <a href='https://amzn.to/30OqRW0'>5050SMD LED</a> lighting which is mounted on 1.25-inch x 1/16-inch aluminum bar as a heatsink. I went with the 5050's because of heat concerns. I live in a cold-cold place with people who do not like the cold so even in winter, my ambient temperatures hover at 30C. Of course, the easiest solution would be to deal with the ambient temperature first, but, this will be an iterative process. The ends and cables are sealed with silicon and adhesive lined heatshrink. <h3>JUNCTION BOX</h3> The junction box is used to hide various electronics and other gadgets and is mounted using various pieces of bent aluminum flatbar. Did I mention flatbars are pretty sweet? The dimmer is for the LED strips which is likely to be replaced with a resistor very soon. Unfortunately the temp/humidity monitor has only a probe for temperature and not for humidity thus it is measuring humidity inside the junction box and not the bucket. <a href='https://i.imgur.com/j3gq6Ka.png'>Behind the junction box is the passive intake</a>. The intake is covered by a filter which is removable from inside the bucket. Flanges on the side of the mounting bracket act as light baffles/hoods.

The bottom tote is the water reservoir that has a small water pump submerged in it. Also have air pump outside bucket on ground with airstone inside. Used some tubing and one rubber grommet and connecter to connect the first two totes together. I cut out a hole for the nft track to freely drain back into reservoir. For the track I used a small piece of plastic gutter and two 90degree elbows. I cut two holes in track for net pots and used panda film to cover holes.

I planted a few clover plants to test with. There's still a little bit more to do (e.g. either solder the ammeter wire or find a wire nut.) The bucks on the fans aren't necessary but more convenient than not for now. Running the multimeter off of a 9v battery is probably not very sustainable but I'm not sure how else to do it yet. The most annoying problem I'm having is that I can see no indication whatsoever that this boost limits on current no matter how I turn the two potentiometers. Adjusting the voltage clearly works perfectly but the supposed current pot seems to have no effect. It seems fine enough for now though even when it's plenty hot.<strong>p.s. A special thanks to my girlfriend. She did all the aluminum taping. :)</strong><h3>PRIMARY LIGHTING</h3>Cheap 100W - It's around 6500K and claims to output around 10Klm. It just barely fits on to the fan/heat sink. One benefit of this thing is that I overdrove it a couple of times to the point it turned off and it still works perfectly. I'd say that's pretty big plus for quality compared to some of the garbage I've seen on eBay.CPU Combined Heat Sink and Fan - I like it even though it's not ideal for this. It's mounted on using zip ties. It's essentially silent, much like having a laptop in the room. The other exhaust/outtake (red) fan is louder than I'd like but low pitch.Boost converter - I can't recommend this since I'm pretty sure it's defective as it doesn't seem to be limiting on current. If I crank the voltage all the way up, there's no way to lower the current regardless of which way the pot is cranked to.<h3>BUCKET CONFIGURATION</h3>The bucket was ordered on amazon because there's pretty much no choice in buckets whatsoeever in Sweden, especially at a reasonable price. No ability to add spacers but I'm fine with that. Most of what you see is attached via zip ties and all of the converters well as the multimeter are attached using sticky tack (pretty much blu-tack but not blue.)The LED + boost are fed by an old laptop power supply with a max 19V @ 3.42A(?) rating. Led strips are the same one's everyone else is using from user leds-for-you on eBay. I chose the warm white ones with waterproofing. I think if I were to do it again, I'd go with cool white because I'd want more bluer light lower down on the plant. It came with it's own power supply/driver. The fans are powered by old phone chargers (12-14V) and use these two buck converters. I mainly went with voltage adjusted speed just because I wanted to play with converters. I'll probably replace them with PWM knobs or something in the future.<h3>FUTURE PLANS</h3>One thing I'm considering adding is G4 LEDs since I have four of them and they are VERY blue-ish (even though they claim to be 6500K on the dot.) They can run on pretty much anything too, so they're quite convenient. I would mainly use those lower down in an attempt to keep plants smaller. The taping is just aluminum tape sold by Conrad (a German site which has an outled in Sweden.) We just roughly calculated the surface area of the inside and bought twice as much as we needed.","v":"2654","g":"5gal,custom,pcfan","z":"B000O8I474,B00CZ75TWA,B00MZSHX6Y,B00R5DZLEA,B01339F06I","i":[{"h":"1-3.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"10-1.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"10.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"2-3.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"4-3.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"5-3.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"6-3.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"7-3.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"8-1.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"9.jpg","s":"100"}]},{"t":"NO-SOLDER LED","s":"no-solder-led","a":"bosslines","d":"2019-08-31","c":"<strong>BUCKET ASSEMBLY</strong> The assembly is standard stuff. I used a box cutter to cut the bottom off of two buckets. Two upper bucket portions make up the light top, along with a lid that had holes for the LED and the heatsink mounting screws. A hot knife would have worked better. A space blanket was used for reflective mylar on the inside. It works but was hard to install; I prefer white paint. Black duct tape covers the outside.\n<strong>COST ESTIMATES</strong> The total cost of the light is around $50. Switching to a Vero 29 would approximately double that. The fan PCB has about $5 worth of parts on it, and the fans were about $20. In total, there is less than $100 in the bucket itself, though I spent more and have extra parts and materials for the next bucket (including 100 of the fan power boards!). The modular design means that most of the parts are reusable.\n<strong>ADDRESSING SAFETY</strong> I plug the bucket into a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual-current_device'>GFCI outlet</a> in case anything were to short. You can and should buy <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Tower-Manufacturing-30439005-3-Wire-Adapter/dp/B00UOU6OVU/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1439152604&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=gfci' >separate GFCI adapters</a> if you don't have a GFCI outlet. Additional fuses, especially thermal fuses if the LED overheats, would be beneficial and I intend to add them soon. Making sure all wires are strain-relieved and taped down is important to ensure that, if they come loose, they don't short to anything.\n<strong>POWER CONSUMPTION</strong> We can read all about lm/W of LEDs, but ultimately we care how much power we'll have to pay for from the utility. Here are the power measurement for this bucket 'at the wall' usining a <a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00009MDBU/ref=sr_ph_1?m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1439154695&amp;sr=sr-1&amp;keywords=kill+a+watt'>Kill-a-Watt</a> power meter: light only: 38.4W; light + fans: 44.2W. I pay $0.18/kWh for electricity, so if I run the fans 24 hrs./day and the light 18 hrs./day, I pay about $4.50/month to run this bucket. This is somewhat better than CFLs. Assuming I'm getting around the rated output of 3662lm, that puts the light at about 95 lm/W including power supply inefficiency.\n<strong>FAN POWER</strong> In keeping with the goal of a no-solder build, I designed and built a small circuit board to distribute 12V power from a wall wart to 4 4-pin pc fan connectors and a screw terminal. (Technically I did solder the board, but I set the rules so I'll allow it :).) Plug in the wall wart's jack and the fans and you're done, no cutting and splicing. This also has the benefit of being able to unplug the fans, allowing me to totally separate the light top from the bucket itself. I will eventually also use the 12V output on the screw terminals to power an LED strip. This board is very simple, but provides an easy way to distrubute 12V around the bucket.\n<h3>LIGHTING CONFIGURATION</h3>\nFrom the beginning, I planned to use LED COB arrays because they provide a lot of light with low cost and low power consumption. COB stands for 'chip on board,' meaning it contains an array of multiple LED chips in a single package. One example is the '100W LED' you commonly see on eBay. COBs are used for LED downlight and spotlight fixtures, so their directional nature is perfect for a Space Bucket.\nBased on guidance from <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/HandsOnComplexity/comments/17nxpy/using_a_lux_meter_as_a_plant_light_meter/'>SAG's light guide</a>, I wanted to have about 40000 lux to hit a sweet spot of photosynthetic efficiency vs. electrical efficiency. That is, more light is both harder for the plant to convert to energy and harder for the light to produce efficiently.\nAssuming a 30cm diameter bucket and 20% loss, I would need about 3600 lumens of output (lux=lumens/area). I ultimately selected a <a href='http://www.bridgelux.com/products/vero-series'>Bridgelux Vero 18</a> with a 3000K color temperature, nominal 3662lm output at 1.05A drive current, and 122 lm/W. Not too shabby! Note that the <a href='/materials'>standard Space Bucket setup</a> of 4 23W CFLS produces about 6400lm, but the LED output is more directional and the goal for this build is to use as little light as possible. These are ballpark calculations to figure out a minimal amount of white light needed, YMMV depending on spectrum, plant selection, desired outcome, etc. If you want maximum output, you could build a similar light using a Vero 29, the largest Bridgelux array, with appropriate heatsink and power supply.\n<h3>POWER SUPPLY</h3>\nLEDs are characterized by their forward voltage and forward current, and COBs are no different. You should use an efficient AC-to-DC constant-current supply with COBs to avoid thermal runaway and perform gracefully if the LED array partially fails. Pick the current you want, and ensure that your supply can provide that current at the required forward voltage. If it can't, look for a supply with a higher power rating.\nThe Vero 18 is characterized at 700mA and 1050mA. I tried both currents and ultimately settled on 1050mA because it is the recommended current (and the one required to get the output I wanted), and it didn't make the heatsink too hot to touch continuously (see THERMAL MANAGEMENT below). There are lots of driver options on eBay and Ali Express, but I prefer to buy components with proper regulatory certifications and someone I can complain to if things go wrong. I selected the <a href='http://www.meanwellusa.com/product/led/LED.html'>Mean Well</a> APC-35-1050. Its typical efficiency is 84%. You can spend more and get better efficiency or features like dimming or power factor correction, but this was good enough and very inexpensive.\n<h3>THERMAL MANAGEMENT</h3>\nThe Bridgelux Vero series has another benefit, which is that there are a lot of supporting products on the market. Aavid Thermalloy makes <a href='http://www.aavid.com/led-cooling/solutions-by-light-engine-manufacturer/bridgelux-led-arrays-guide'>heatsinks for the Vero series</a> that already have the mounting holes drilled and tapped. Their heatsinks are compatible with their Nuventix synthetic jet coolers, which use a piezo diaphragm to pulse air through the heatsink fins to increase their cooling capacity much like a heatsink fan. Their advantages are that they last longer than fans (why have a 30k hour led and a 10k hour fan?) and that they are quieter. Their disadvantage is that they are expensive.\nI bought the Aavid Thermalloy 'Downlight 48W' heatsink that has mounting holes for Vero 18 and is the biggest one they make, hoping that it would be sufficient without active cooling. I also got a Nuventix SynJet cooler that fits it to try out. The LED is mounted on the heatsink using two M2.5 screws, with thermal grease in between. The thermal grease is the same stuff you use on a CPU if you build a PC, and it's necessary to ensure good thermal contact between LED and heatsink.\nHigh power LEDs, including COBs, need heatsinks to keep the LED itself (junction temperature) below the rated maximum so you don't burn them out, and preferably as low as possible to maximize the LED lifetime. You can <a href='http://www.eevblog.com/2009/12/19/eevblog-50-solid-state-led-lighting-and-how-thermal-design-sucks/'>estimate how hot the LED will get</a> (temperature rise) based on how much power you're dissipating, the ambient temperature, and the thermal resistance of the LED package, thermal grease, and heatsink, but these calculations almost always make too many assumptions to be accurate. So using an <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Etekcity-Lasergrip-Non-contact-Thermometer-Temperature/dp/B00837ZGRY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1439158513&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ir+thermometer'>IR thermometer</a>, I tested how much the temperature of the heatsink rose with two LED currents (700mA and 1050mA) and three cooling setups (no cooling, SynJet cooler, and PC fan). The full 1050mA with no cooling still kept the heatsink touch-able (below 50°C), and backing out the LED junction temperature from the heatsink temperature indicated the LED was well below its maximum temperature. The SynJet cooler worked, but not as well as the fan.

What great things these buckets are. I've been enjoying messing with this DIY project enormously. Haven't enjoyed/learned this much from a project in a good while. I'v nearly been enjoying the bucket more then it's aim... Enough waffling though, onto the build. This is my first bucket (it has been revised a good few times), but now it's at the point at which i'm happy enough with it to share. Here's what it looks like; Using the LED as a main light was gotten through SAG's excellent guide, and has given me great results. The water cooler is great for it, making the voltage booster the limiting factor. Later I plan on using a power supply along with a better LED and try to 'overclock' (overvolt?) it. The side lights are not being used (the ones visible form the outside, not the LED strip) as they have too high a beam angle (30Degrees) and do too much damage to the leaves.\n<b><u>Future Plans</u></b>\nI live at relatively high latitude (53) making it difficult for the ol' plant to be happy in a room during winter without having to heat the whole thing (which is silly just for the one bucket). Having lurked for a while on the Reddit forums, and seeing nothing 'standard' for this problem I decided to have some fun and keep the DIYing going. Making a water-warmed system in the bucket's soil, like the opposite of pc water cooling, seemed like a good bet. The biggest obstacle was keeping the delicate roots at a happy temp without breaking the bank. An aquarium heater turns out to be made for this. Being relatively cheap and made to handle the ambient temps of sensitive little fishies - it's made for this. Here is a picture + schematic of the loop. (I haven't gotten to try it, as having planted the current girl directly into 20L of soil, which would have been too difficult to transplant. So the next one will try this heater out. Despite the fact that temps inside should be OK by then).\nA quick test of the loop/system has given good results, managing to keep the water and soil pretty stable. Bare in mind that the aim isn't to keep the soil at optimal temps 100% of the time, but rather to lessen the drop of the temperature at night and stop the bad stunning/reactions of the plant that occurred in the current (first) grow. Well that's all for now, <span style='font-size: 17.2px;line-heighg: 1.6em'>thanks for reading and a huge thanks to Ekrof, SAG and the rest of the super-active community.","v":"1857","g":"5gal,custom,pcfan","z":"B000VBW17S,B009OXSFBA,B00CZ75TWA,B01339F06I","i":[{"h":"8hMSla5.jpg","s":"133.3"},{"h":"sq0CDsI.jpg","s":"133.3"}]},{"t":"BUCKET TRON","s":"POstoned","a":"POstoned","h":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceBuckets/comments/4nhaz1/the_story_of_buckettron/","d":"2017-03-15","c":"Hey fellow bucketeers!

The bin is already lightproof as it it doesn't let absolutely any light out when the lid is on. I use a mylar space blanket as a reflective surface, it is a bit of a pain in the ass as it has a lot of fold lines. I left a few extra inches of mylar off the top of the bin: once the lid is in place, it covers the gap between the 2. I'm also using a lot of zip ties to secure the componets to the main container, mainly the power strip and fans. \n<h3>AIRFLOW</h3>\nFor the bucket ventilation I'm using a combination of different kind of fans. The main intake is a 6 inch 110v fan that was really easy to install, just plug and play. <strong>This is a powerful fan that creates great circulation inside the container. </strong>For the top exhaust I'm using a mini fan that should be enough to extract the heat for the light bulbs. I think I might add elbows to the fans to prevent light leaks, I am more concerned with light getting in during flowering than light getting out, so I will cross that bridge when I get to it. \n<h3>LIGHTING STUFF</h3><strong>For the lighting configuration I'm using 4x23wCFL + 1x26wCFL on the lid</strong>, with adjustable height and a 5 meter, 300 LED strip (5050) outdoor use, pure white color.

I painted the bucket flat black outside and inside with several layers. Then I painted the top half inside white (bottom is dirt). When I tested with light on, there were several spots that needed yet another layer. Overall, I am pleased with the light proofing this method provided, but be prepared to use at least 1 can of flat black just for light proofing Intake has the fan on the outside, with a 4' duct attached at an angle for light proofing. Exhaust fan is attached inside with a 4' adjustable elbow glued into the hole in the side, with a string holding it for support. The carbon filter sits on this elbow perfectly, alas, by coincidence. As of now, I prefer attaching the fan inside rather than the outside, mainly because you can then secure the ducting through the bucket, making it a lot more sturdy. I am planning to build a drip system where vinegar is dripped into a base of baking soda, producing C02 for the babies. This technique is used in grow rooms, so I think it will work quite nicely in a bucket. <h3>FUTURE PLANS</h3> PRIMER! Too many paint chips made this job a repaint hassle Install the fans BEFORE the LED strip. Things got in the way of each other. Make much smaller carbon filter Glue gun goes not work on the metal part, not well. Epoxy that part next time. Seriously exploring the idea of a square bucket.

The light-top ventilation features a 120mm Axial Fan with 110cfm.<h3>OTHER STUFF</h3>I'm testing an airflow configuration with 4 intakes. <strong>Used PVC elbows to block all the light coming of out the bucket. </strong>I have mounted a fan speed controller and 12v 5A power supply for LED strip to the side. Tubes and valves came from a local home store similar to Lowes or Home Depot (it's half inch tubing). I built a runoff tray mounted a hose with valve for easy emptying. For this I'm using inch and a half screws installed about 2 inches apart. Also I wanted to be able to water without taking off the top every time. Trying out a watering system using a cheap squirt bottle with bottom cut out, a simple valve, and a hose with a ring of hose with small holes. Not sure how well this will work but I'm gonna try it.<h3>FUTURE ROADMAP</h3><strong>I'm going to try some different designs</strong> but might have to add a 2nd fan. Currently with 1 fan and no filter my bucket holds steady at 75-76°F while the temp in the room is 69-70°F. All I have left to do is my carbon scrubber. The first one I made was 'too good' and wouldn't let enough air through even with my 110cfm fan.","v":"3034","g":"110v,5630,5gal,cfl","z":"B000VBW17S,B002QVFN7G,B00BPIWY28,B00M6SR1JM","i":[{"h":"1-1.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"2-1.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"3-1.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"4-1.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"5-1.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"6-1.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"7-1.jpg","s":"100"}]},{"t":"SAWFOX BUILD","s":"sawfox","a":"Sawfox","d":"2017-10-27","c":"This is my bucket!

If you can find white 5gal buckets and got a different color, line the inside of the bucket with tin foil so the inside light will be reflected and not absorbed by the bucket walls. White buckets reflect the light just fine without the lining, but you can line white buckets if you really want to. For the remaining buckets, cut the lids off, leaving about 2'-3' of plastic to it doesn't slip off somehow. I left 4'-5' because I was lazy and this is only crucial if the extra plastic will hit a fan or whatever else you have installed in the sides of the bucket. You can always cut more off, too. I added a watering apparatus to the side of my bucket, but this is completely optional... I'm just a dork. It consists of numerous PVC parts and feed water into the bucket through a plastic tube with holes in it. Decently effective, more for show than anything. I also mounted my humidity sensor in the side of the bucket, display facing out and the back entirely covered save for the actual sensor that needs access to air. I don't worry about accidentally watering it and I don't have to open my bucket for a reading.</div></div><strong>Hello everyone!</strong> So I just moved to Oregon and am marking my new life here by growing my first plant, <strong>and I'm using a Space Bucket because of low cost and mobility</strong>. More info about my build <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceBuckets/comments/3ii2ee/journal_2cents_spacebucket_v12/'>here</a>. <h3>LIGHTING</h3> I was originally plugging the lights directly into the 1-way socket adapters, so they were sticking straight out from the power strip. This isn't the most efficient and I've since adopted an updated design to spread light more evenly. Plug the three 1-way adapters into the power strip, skipping a socket between each. Get the bucket lid and turn the power strip over so it's standing on those 1-way adapters, position the strip on the lid so the lights will be centered, and trace and cut out the area for each adapter on the lid. Push the adapters through and see if everything lines up and stays in place, adjusting where necessary. Once you're happy with the power strip's position, screw the two 2-way bulb-to-light-socket adapters into the 1-way adapters at each end of the strip, making sure the 'Y' shape is perpendicular to the length of the power strip (sticks out to the sides). Screw the light bulbs to make sure the socket positioning is good and place the lid on your bucket, then plug in the power strip. If the bulbs are spaced evenly and everything looks good to you, set it aside. <h3>AIRFLOWING</h3> As you add spacers to keep the lights from burning the plant, more and more hot air will stay up towards where the lights are, and the 80mm fans towards the bottom of the bucket may not be able to get that air out. I added a 120mm PC fan up next to the lights as a dedicated exhaust, and my temps are just fine. This also helps lower humidity, which can lead to powdery mildew, which is no bueno. Find where on the sides of the bucket you want your fans to go, ensuring the wires from each fan meet at some point on the outside of the bucket with a bit of slack, which is where the plug for power will be. I placed my fans about 6'-8' up from the bottom of the bucket on either side - one for intake, one for exhaust. If you only have one fan available to you, use it for exhaust. Trace the fans on the bucket and cut out the plastic, then insert the fans making sure the direction of air flow is pointing the correct way. I didn't need to tape them in place because I was able to squeeze them through the hole, which was just a shade too small, so they're held in place pretty well. Take the fan wires, strip about 1/2' of plastic off the end, then join the two red ends together, and the black ends together. Do not connect red to black, or vice versa. Twist the metal wires together to form two wire ends, then get the adapter and put the red ends into the positive (+) slot and the black ends into the negative (-) slot. Use a screwdriver to fasten the ends into place...you may need to re-adjust if the ends slip out easily. I like to hold everything by the adapter so the fans dangle... if the wire ends slip out, re-adjust/re-tighten. Test the fans with the 1A power supply, and if both fans turn on and move a good amount of air, go ahead and mount them in the sides of the bucket, again making sure one is for intake and the other is for exhaust.","v":"2784","g":"5gal,cfl,pcfan","z":"","i":[{"h":"a12.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"a5.jpg","s":"120"},{"h":"b10.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"b4.jpg","s":"120"},{"h":"c2.jpg","s":"120"},{"h":"c8.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"d2.jpg","s":"120"},{"h":"d8.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"e6.jpg","s":"133.3"}]},{"t":"REVAMPED BUCKET","s":"ser_revamp","a":"Ser_NSFW","d":"2016-01-31","c":"I wanted an <strong>easily-removable bucket top and a clean grow area</strong> in which to place pots of different sizes. My second attempt at building a basic bucket left me with a bucket with perfectly-drilled holes (if I do say so myself) and only one small hole cut into the side where a complicated and ultimately useless watering apparatus used to live, so I decided those holes would be perfect for a passive intake. They also double as drainage holes... though I'll need to figure something out for when I upgrade to a 3 gallon Smart Pot, because it'll cover the holes and block the passive intake.\nI have 5x23W <a href='https://amzn.to/3jMfTYw'>CFL bulbs</a>, each putting out 1600 lumens for a total of 8000 lumens. I also have a few LED red+blue grow strips on the bucket walls at plant-level to bolster growth in lower regions of the plant when it's bigger. The light bulbs are screwed into socket plugs and plugged into the top power strip. The pairs of bulbs are joined by a 'Y' socket connector, which is screwed into a socket plug. You can kind of tell from the first picture, but it's fucking bright in there.\n<h3>AIRFLOW</h3> My old bucket top had two small intake fans in the lid and a 100mm exhaust fan at light-level. Since I decided to go with a passive intake, <strong>I flipped all the fans to exhaust</strong>, and added a fourth, 120mm PC fan opposite the 100mm fan. I killed a brand new 120mm PC fan in the process, pour some out for one's homies. With all the lights and fans on, after about an hour the temperature inside went down from ~77F to 72F and held...perfect temps :D\n<h3>WIRING</h3> I stripped the plastic off the ends of each fan and taped them together in pairs - the two smaller lid fans got taped together (BLACK to BLACK; RED to RED), and the two side fans got taped together. Then I took each pair of fans and twisted the two ends together before securing them in a female plug. All four fans are powered by one power supply... for a while I thought the fourth PC fan was too much because it didn't work at first, but after some trial and error, all went to plan - and the LED strips are powered by their own power supply, which is plugged into the same power strip as the lights. <strong>The fans are separate from the lights</strong>, which is a nice change from previous bucket versions I used.

The holes will enable water drainage once the plant is inside. You can choose put reflective material on the walls. This will optimize the lighting once the light-top is stacked. <a href='http://amzn.to/2nTVcg9'>Mylar</a> sticks neatly with most glues. <strong>If you have white buckets, this covering is optional</strong>, the walls will be already reflective.Cover the outside of your main bucket with black tape, this will make it lightproof. You’re looking for lumen tightness. Finally, get your extra buckets and cut the top off: the resulting spacers can be <strong>stacked to the main bucket to add height</strong> to the garden.<h3>AIRFLOW</h3>Once you have prepared your main container, cut holes on the sides to fit the PC Fans (8x8 are preferred). <strong>Two fans per bucket is a standard recommendation.</strong> Use the lower fan as intake, and keep the exhaust close to the lights to extract the heat. If you have only one fan, use it an active exhaust and keep the intake passive. Wire the fans with a <a href='http://amzn.to/2mGyDKT'>12v power supply</a> (a standard 2A PSU can run two fans). You can <strong>glue a <a href='http://amzn.to/2nc8JCy'>power strip</a> to one side of the main bucket.</strong> Here you will connect the lights (and timer) and the 12v power supply for the fans, among other things.<h3>LIGHTING CONFIGURATION</h3>It is time to build the light-top. <strong>We recommend at least 100 true Watts of CFL</strong>, 4 or 5 bulbs that can be arranged in many configurations. Mixing warm and cool spectrums is encouraged.Start by picking the best bucket-top and lid you have available. This process can be simplified using this <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0091HO0FY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0091HO0FY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=spacbuck-20'>easy 4 way adapter</a>. If you prefer custom wiring, make holes on the walls of the bucket-top to fit E27 bulb sockets, and connect them in parallel. <strong>Always solder and tape your wires!</strong> Twisting the leads is not safe enough (wire nuts can be used too).

However, I have been a maker for many years. After doing some research, I decided that a DWC Hydro bucket would be the cleanest and easiest for me to manage. Stealth is not an issue in my household, but I wanted it to be very easy to maintain, and be very unobtrusive. It seemed to me that the highest maintenance item was changing the water once a week. Therefore I wanted this to be made incredibly easy. In that vein, I came up with a way to have the water bucket be just that, just a bucket, with no attachments, or cords to deal with. When it’s time to change the water, I mix my new nutrient and pH’d water in the empty bucket. Then, I simply lift the entire assembly off the old water bucket, and set it on the new one. If I don’t do it quick enough, I do have to re-prime the aquarium pump. I went with the smallest pump, and in my opinion, it’s a little underpowered for the 12 inches of vertical travel or ‘head’ that it needs to overcome.\n<h3>Planning</h3> The second consideration was light leak from the <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>UFO LED light</a>. I’ve seen many pictures on space buckets, and realize that the greatest source of these light leaks is the fans in the side of the bucket. This is the reason for the black elbows in the parts list above. I trimmed the 80 mm fans to fit inside the elbows, and then installed the elbows to the side of the bucket. These will also serve the purpose of holding a carbon filter when I switch to flower. I understand that the fans may not be powerful enough for this, but I have a bit of time to plan and design for that. I also noticed that a lot of people like to modify the <a href='https://amzn.to/36NO5zr'>UFO LED light</a> assembly, I didn’t want to do this, and decided that the UFO sitting on top of the bucket would work reasonably well for me so that I did not have to modify it in any way. It is my intention at some point to further automate the system with an Arduino, and compatible sensors for TDS, pH, temperature, and humidity. However, it’s working just fine at the moment and I have other projects to finish first… <strong>So, what we are going to create at this point is two different modules.</strong> One will be the Hydro module, and the other will be the light/fan module.\n<h3>Assembly</h3> Fan modification: Use the Dremel with a cut off wheel to trim the tabs from one side of one of the 80 mm PC fans. Then, proceed to trim the tabs off the opposite side of the other fan. You will probably need to do a bit of test fitting with the elbow, but trim off enough so that it fits in snugly but not completely jammed in.\nFor the fan that has the fan blades exposed outside of the elbow, do yourself a favor and zip tie a fan blade cover to it. I almost lost the tip of my thumb while checking airflow inside the bucket during assembly. In the end, it cost me a bit of blood, a small slice of pride, and the cost of another nine dollar fan. <strong>I recommend 4-wire fan because it has a speed control</strong>. If you’re not familiar with these, two of the wires are for power, one is a tachometer, and the other is a PWM speed control. You would need a micro controller to fully utilize this, but there is a very simple hack that I have used with no problems for this build. While researching how to figure out which of the wires was which, it was suggested that I simply connect the non-power wires one at a time to the ground wire. The PWM wire when attached to ground, will slow the fan down considerably. During the build, I simply attach this wire to the ground wires and it runs fine. The remaining tachometer wire is not used at this point in the project.\n<h3>Light and fan module</h3> I use the fan without the elbow attached to size the hole on the side of one of the white buckets towards the top. Cut this out just a little bit smaller than the fan size. Next, set the bucket on your workbench, place the fan inside the elbow, and then position the lower hole for the intake fan so that the elbow rests on your workbench along with the bucket. At first, I had it positioned too low, and the bucket would not rest on the workbench level. You want this for whenever you take the bucket off to admire your plant! You must also cut a hole in the bottom of this bucket so that there is about 1/4 inch left of the bottom. This is where the radius tool for the Dremel comes in very handy. I used the side cutter bit along with the radius tool to do this. It’s a slow process, and messy, so do it outside if it all possible. Have patience, take your time, and it will be a very smooth, round cut. While you have your radius tool out, you should go ahead and modify two of the white lids. Remove the locking strip from one of the lids, and cut it so that there is about a 1 inch lip on the inside of the lid for the UFO LED. Make sure that you cut the hole just big enough so that it does not block any of the light, but the UFO rests comfortably on it. The other lid will sit on top of the net pot, and you can leave the locking strip on this, as this will help it fit more snugly on top of the net pot. Cut the hole with the radius tool so that there is about 1/2 inch left of the lid for the light/fan bucket module to rest on. Set this lid aside and we will discuss it further when we get to the Hydro module.\nNow to install the fans! Push the fans into the elbows and adjust them so they are about 15° out of line with the bend of the elbow. Pop them into the square hole that you cut, and then turn the assembly so that the elbows are pointing directly down toward the floor. This will put the fans out of line with the hole, thereby locking them into place. After this is done, zip tie the fan cover to the top fan to save your tender digits from decapitation… Run the wires around the side of the fan and connect the positive and negative wires together. Connect the PWM wires to the ground wire. Then attach it to your power supply. I already had some Molex connectors for this, Feel free to connect these in anyway you deem safe. See the electrical safety guide in the space buckets forum if you’re uncomfortable with this part of the procedure. It is low voltage, so it doesn’t need to be over engineered. I chose white buckets for this part of the build so that I did not need to worry about reflectivity inside. The black duct tape is for light leakage and you can work on that now. It took me two layers to overcome the brightness of the UFO LED, YMMV. I also was careful not to put the adhesive from the duct tape on the wires for the fans, as I do intend to modify this so that I have control of the fan speed later. Eventually these will be put into shrink tubing and attached to the micro controller.\nBe sure to tape the lids that you have modified, and check for light leaks in the entire system when it’s dark. Even if you are not concerned about the glow from the LED, you still want to seal as many light leaks as possible so that you don’t have problems when you switch to a 12/12 schedule for flower.\n<h3>Hydro module</h3> As mentioned above, I designed this part of the system for ease of water change out. The black buckets are unmodified to make this as easy as possible. The only thing that I might do to these buckets is a clear plastic sight tube on the outside so that I can monitor water level. Here is one possible solution: http://www.instructables.com/id/Sight-Glass-For-Hydroponics-Buckets/?ALLSTEPS Taking this into consideration, the net pot lid by itself is not stable enough to handle everything that we need for this part of the module, so we are going to heavily modify one of the black buckets for this. As an aside, I used a white bucket for this piece, but I have since changed the parts list to reflect using a black bucket as it will save you a lot of time and tape. Using the dremel with the cut off wheel, cut a three sided flap in the upper part of the bucket to slip the power plug from the aquarium pump through. Include a hole for the wire to sit in. This must be above the level where the bucket would nest inside of another bucket. Then, using the cut off wheel, or a sawsall, cut the bottom off of this bucket about 3 inches below where it rests on top of another bucket. I also removed the wire handle as it was in the way. Now, put the lid from earlier on the net pot and the net pot on top of the cut off bucket. Now you can drill a hole in the net pot lid for the quarter inch tubing that will come from the pump. Zip tie the power cord for the pump to the tubing to keep it stable and support the weight of the pump. The power cord goes through the side flap of the cut off bucket, and the tubing goes through the hole in the net pot. Leave 2 to 3 inches of tubing sticking out the top of the hole in the net pot and we will make a drip ring later. I would advise you to adjust the power cord, and drip tubing so that the pump hangs just above the bottom of the water bucket. If it rests on the bottom, you are likely to get an annoying vibration from the pump. I plan to modify this with a support that goes down the side of the cut off bucket when I go to a heavier water pump. But if you have the very small 40 gallon per hour pump, it can easily support itself from the power cord and water tubing. The drip ring is assembled from 8 or 9 of the plastic tees, with about 1 1/4 inch of tubing between them. One is turned facing out and goes into the tubing coming up from the pump, and the others are pointed inward to drip onto your grow medium. I added a small piece of tubing to a couple of these so that they would drip directly onto the rock wool where my clone is sitting. Put some water in the bucket, plug the pump in, and test the system to make sure that you don’t need to prime it and that it runs consistently without problems. You don’t want to find this out later when you check on it one morning and find your clone dried up because the pump failed.\n<h3>Full bucket assembly</h3> So, let’s build this thing! Put the aquarium pump in the water bucket, and feed the power cord and water line through the cut off bucket that you assembled earlier. Put the White lid that you cut with a thin lip on top of the net pot. On top of this goes the fan and light module. On top of this bucket goes the lid with the wider lip to fit the UFO light, and the UFO light goes on top of that. At this point, you need to arrange the cords for the aquarium pump, the power supply for the fans, and the UFO light so that they all join on the side of the fan light module. You can drill holes to zip tie a power strip to the side of the fan light module to accommodate all of the plugs. The other thing that you need to have on the fan light module is your timer module. The UFO light will plug into this, and it will plug into the power strip. This doesn’t have to be super neat, I assembled it so that everything was on one side up against the wall, so it’s not as obvious that there something going on with it to the casual observer. My advice is to let this run for a day or two with water in the bottom bucket, the pump running, and the fans, light, and timer running. This will ensure that everything is running correctly before you trust it with your precious plant… Later, as your plant gets taller, you will want to make a secondary light module in the form of the remaining white bucket with the bottom cut off, the remaining lid cut out like the one on the net pot, and the LED strips… I will update as I modify the bucket.","v":"2814","g":"arduino,pcfan,ufo","z":"","i":[{"h":"1.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"2.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"3.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"4.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"5.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"6.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"7.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"8.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"9.jpg","s":"100"}]},{"t":"SUGAR SPACE SHUTTLE","s":"SugarBallz","a":"SugarBallz_","d":"2016-11-30","c":"I present my Space Shuttle!

His build features 56 watts LEDs including power supplies (49 watts on the warm white LEDs). Seven 8 watt lights/modules: 4 on top, 3 on the side. Cost was about  subsidized by the local power company. Side and intracanopy lighting is about increasing the effective leaf area index (the amount of leaves receiving direct light). Lights held in place by 5 minute epoxy. There is a single 40mm fan, temps never go above 3 degrees F above ambient. (1.5 degrees typical). In testing flat white paint, unpainted white bucket, Panda Plastic white sheeting, Mylar and aluminum foil, Mylar and the foil came out on top with a virtual tie. <h3>LIGHTING INNOVATION</h3> Put a bulb that has all the LEDs shining in one direction in double plastics bags and smash the glass. Pick and file as needed. During picking there were tiny bits of glass flying up in my face so use eye protection. I put 4 on a bucket lid. The lamps were wired in parallel with solder and heat shrink tubing wire connections to the light sockets used. Scotch Super 33+ (the best standard electrical tape) was wrapped around the connection to provide good electrical and mechanical isolation. Four bulbs were daisy chained together so I had only one LED light cord to deal with from the lid. Rubber glue with a brush was used to cement the Mylar to the bucket lid. You can see the ducting on the underside from the 90 degree PVC bend. <strong>The LED heatsinks are outside the Space Bucket!</strong> The side light is a the same LED light as the top of the lids but the LED module is removed and mounted on 1/8th aluminum that is 1 1/2 inch wide and 8 inches long. So I remove the LED modules but still use the lighting power supply. This means I'm working with safe, low voltage lights around the plant canopy. Speaker wire was used for the low voltage lighting and the speaker wire is soldered to the output of the light's power supply, heat shrink tubing, wire stress relieved with a tie-wrap and taped up with the Scotch Super 33+ electrical tape. So, I get <strong>custom lighting with no electronics work</strong> beyond a little bit of soldering. Do at you own risk but for fast and easy bucket side lighting, this is an easy way to go. You can typically use heat grease and screw the module down but I just use 5 minute epoxy around the edge of the LED module. Allow 5 hours to cure other wise you may end up with a gooey mess. <h3>PLANT JOURNAL</h3> Grand Daddy Purple, a fairly low yielding indica (note, I can get +3 oz per square foot under HPS with intracanopy LED lighting in soil off a related strain, Purple Arrow). 60 days flowering, right out of the cloning aeroponic chamber. I did leave it in the aero chamber an extra 7 days to rapidly build up the roots while doing a foliar feeding. I use Miracle-Gro Moisture Control soil. With ultra high lighting levels you either need to go hydroponics or use a soil that holds more moisture. You can add vermiculite or something but I hate vermiculite and perlite. When I first started growing in 1995 I used a 50/50 blend ebb and flow. Crap got everywhere! They're like little static electric magnets. Ignore the time release fertilizer claim- that's more suited to low light house plants and insignificant to this type of growing. Fertilizer: General Hydroponics 3 part Flora series at 1200 ppm, pH 6.5. I had to use a 50/50 grow/bloom mixture due to the higher lighting levels. A bloom mixture alone isn't going to cut it as I found out due to chlorosis (chlorophyll breakdown from too low of nitrogen). Every 3 days I would flush the plant with plain water at pH 6.8 and then add the fertilizer solution at 1200 ppm. Plain water flush for the last 10 days. So, I missed my projected goal of 28 grams by 2 grams. The nugs were surprisingly dense with all the extra photosynthesis going on.","v":"18749","g":"5gal,pcfan,sag","e":"gallery,resources,led ideas","z":"","i":[{"h":"6M2a1iD.jpg","s":"85.4"},{"h":"a.jpg","s":"66.8"},{"h":"a2.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"b.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"c2.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"d.jpg","s":"66.5"},{"h":"DlP37aL.jpg","s":"91.9"},{"h":"e.jpg","s":"66.5"},{"h":"f.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"i.jpg","s":"66.5"},{"h":"j.jpg","s":"66.5"},{"h":"k.jpg","s":"66.5"},{"h":"l.jpg","s":"66.5"},{"h":"m.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"n.jpg","s":"66.5"},{"h":"Qgwdmwq.jpg","s":"90.7"},{"h":"vsA6b0L.jpg","s":"74.3"}]},{"t":"SWITCH THERMOSTAT","s":"switch-thermostat","a":"SpaceBucketFu","h":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceBuckets/comments/5v9ttj/quick_diy_12v_exhaust_system_control_half_assed/","d":"2019-09-18","c":"Worried about energy consumption?

Thought I'd chime in with my first bucket build. Have been reading for a few months, gathering as much info as possible. <strong>Finally built my bucket about 2 weeks ago</strong>. I'm living in a place which doesn't have much available in terms of electronics and growing supplies. so I had to make a couple of shortcuts, but will be improving my build with time. The first upgrade is better fans, which are on the way.<h3>DESIGN SPECS</h3>The fans were hacked from a laptop cooler, the only fans I could find in my location. Have found someone to bring me some 120mm PC fans to replace these. <strong>Planning to put a fan on the top exhaust too</strong>, so it'll end up with 3 120mm fans (2 at the bottom, 1 on top). For lighting I have 2x 38watt LED grow bulbs, and a <a href='https://amzn.to/30OqRW0'>5050SMD LED</a> strip. Will be adding a second 5050 once my fans arrive. The second LED strip will go below the intake fans. Heres a picture of my LED strip spacer (currently turned off until the plant gets a bit bigger). Temps are good, averaging 80f. Humidity ranges between 50-50%.<strong>The pipe on the left leads to a water reservoir</strong> in the bottom of the pot. <strong>The design is inspired by the global bucket and the hempy bucket</strong>. The basic idea is theres a section of soil that touches the water and wicks moisture up to the plant. The majority of the soil is raised above the water, as I understand the need for a wet/dry cycle and avoiding drowned roots.

Due to some changes, it will now be two 4-bucket tall towers. It turns stacked buckets into airtight chambers, using a 'central' carbon-filtered HVAC module as exhaust. This setup is designed to be easy to take apart, light and air-tight, with as few external components as possible. It also has everything one needs to keep a continuous-growth environment running. I'm almost done building. The latest pictures are here: http://imgur.com/a/fOyUC\nTHE GROW-FLOW TOWER (2 UNITS)\nGrow Unit (90% complete) The bottom and middle buckets fit airtight into each other, but come apart for access to the humidifier and fans in the bottom bucket. An extended 2-gallon bucket hangs from where the middle and top buckets meet, holding a 1 gallon soil pot. The top bucket is lined with a cool-white <a href='https://amzn.to/30TZOZn'>5630SMD LED strip</a>. Hanging 5' into the top bucket is a ventilated, shielded light unit. It holds 4 uncapped <a href='https://amzn.to/3lyKIRa'>LED bulbs</a> at 6,500k, 9.5w each for a total of 38w. \nFlow Unit (complete) The bottom of the bottom bucket is connected with ducting to the veg module it sits on top of. The duct is connected to a 12v 120mm fan, actively pulling air through the veg module, its lighting rig, and into the HVAC module. On its side, the HVAC module accepts a passive duct from the drying module. Air from both sources fills its main chamber, forcing It through a 12' carbon filter which hangs from the underside of a sealed exhaust unit. Inside that unit is a 18w, 110cfm fan pulling air through the filter to exhaust the entire system.\nTHE FLOWER TOWER\nFlower Unit (complete) It holds a 5 gallon grow bag, with the soil line at the top of the bottom bucket. There is a trellis spacer between the bottom and second buckets, and 3-speed active intakes are in the second bucket. The second and third buckets fit together airtight, but come apart for easy access to the bottom of the plants. The third bucket has a SMD5630 LED strip as side lighting.There is an LST net where its third and top buckets meet.  Hanging 5' into the top bucket is the same light unit as the veg module -- except stronger lights. It holds four 14w 2,700k LEDs, for 56 watts. Harvested plants will dry in here.\nCOMING IMPROVEMENTS - I'm investigating a custom COB (Vero 18s) fixture, first for the Flower Tower, then for the Grow Unit. I imagine 4 actively-cooled chips on an adjustable pulley system. - I'm also investigating boosting the sidelighting in the both towers. - Redoing most of the wiring so that it flows through a power supply, inside of a box, attached to the buckets.

Installation was really easy, the hardest part was getting the holes in the brute bin, but with sharp knifes and a drill it was just a matter of patience.

I am using a RaspberryPi with some sensors, relays and a webcam. I am using a DHT22 sensor to measure temperature and humidity, a BH1750 to measure light levels, and a 4 channel relay module to control my lights and water pumps. Sensor information is pushed to the AdafruitIO cloud so I have nice graphs of my growing conditions. I use cron jobs and python scripts to control the timing of the relays for lights and watering. The webcam is managed using the MotionEye package.

I have two builds at the moment, one Brute and one Tote. I plan on using one a filter once I get closer to flowering. That is something I need to research more myself. I want to try and run a single filter which connects to both buckets. <h3>BRUTE STUFF</h3>I purchased the brute trash cans that are not flat inside at the bottom. The ones that are raised in a circle about an inch inside. When I cut through the bottom of the top trash can to accommodate the 5 gallon pot, <strong>I used the excess circle piece that was cut out as my drainage</strong> and drilled holes for over flow into the lid portion. I drilled holes out of the bottom of the lower bucket which lead directly into the main drainage chamber inside the lid. I used 5 bolts and nuts and drilled them in evenly around the bucket. I then sat the 2nd bucket comfortably above the bolts. This allows for the top of the plant to start at the bottom of the 2nd bucket, helping with he space situation.<h3>TOTE STUFF</h3>The tote build features <strong>a 300w LED light, two rolls of LED light strips</strong>, 5 gallon smart pots and intake plus exhaust fans. The containers are two 55 gallon totes and three lids. The construction is pretty straightforward. The middle lid has a hole cut through the entire middle. It is just there to lock the top tote in. I cut out a hole on the bottom of the top tote the same size as the one on the lid. <strong>This allows for a nice and simple way to view the plants</strong> because the light is attached to lid. I cut out two holes the size of the 5 gallon smart pots in the excess of the hole cut to accommodate the lid in the middle of the two totes. As with the brute bucket, I used a lid for the drainage. The tote sits comfortably on top of lid to drain.","v":"4387","g":"cfl,tote,ufo300","z":"B000O8I474,B001B1C4G0,B00BPIWY28,B01B4GQ6MO","i":[{"h":"1-1-1.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"1-2.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"2-2.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"3-2.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"4-2.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"5-2.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"6-2.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"7-2.jpg","s":"100"},{"h":"8.jpg","s":"100"}]},{"t":"THE WHOOTBUCKET","s":"WhoodliusWhoot","a":"WhoodliusWhoot","d":"2016-01-06","c":"I had SO much fun with this supersized build and I cannot wait until my seeds arrive!
