c: "<ul><li><strong>The 'K' in 'color temperature' stands for 'degrees Kelvin', not to mean 'thousand'.</strong> For example, it's a 2700K light, not a 2.7K light which is deep outer space cold. It's also a correlated color temperature (CCT), and not an actual approximate black body radiator color temperature like with a 2700-2800K incandescent light bulb.</li>

<li>I define 'white' as any light source whose spectral output is on or fairly close to the planckian locus in the CIE 1931 color space chromaticity diagram within a certain color temperature range (2700k-6500K or so). <strong>There are many types of white light</strong> (i.e different CCT, CRI, TM-30-15 Rf, spectral power distributions), and many ways to create white, so my definition is a bit vague. Bridgelux has 1750K LEDs they call white, for example, but I certainly don't perceive them as white.</li>

<li>White LEDs (blue LEDs with a phosphor(s) for this discussion) are mass produced very well beyond any other LED lighting, which can make them cheaper through scale of economy, particularly the surface mount medium power LEDs like by Samsung. The amount of R&D into LED technology has resulted in some white LEDs having a PPE of greater than 3 uMol/joule at nominal (lower) current levels and at room temperature. They will max out at about 3.3-3.4ish uMol/joule depending on CCT and CRI, maybe slightly higher if underdriven.</li>

<li>A 450nm blue LED will likely have a maximum practical PPE of about 3.5-3.6 umol/joule, with a maximum theoretical PPE of 3.76 umol/joule. The 3.76 umol/joule number is the ultimate barrier to white LEDs based off a 450nm blue LED with a phosphor, and the only current way to get a higher PPE for grow lights is to add actual red LEDs to white LEDs, or if appropriate for your plant, use red and blue LEDs only (perhaps with some white thrown in).</li>

<li>There are white LEDs that use the phosphor pump from violet or ultraviolet-A LEDs. Our visibility extends down to about 400nm, not 450nm. They use additional broader blue phosphors instead of blue LEDs. But, violet and UV-A LEDs can never have the efficacy of blue LEDs because they have more energy in their photons. We generally wouldn't want to use these types of LEDs in grow light. Seoul Semiconductor Sunlike LEDs use violet LEDs.</li>

<li>In most cases it's one photon per photochemical reaction also known as the <strong>second law of photochemistry</strong>. This applies to photosynthesis and to phosphors. You can have multiple down conversions with phosphors and not break the second law (i.e in a white LED, a photon can be absorbed and emitted multiple times always at lower energy levels), but this does not happen with photosynthesis. This means for photosynthesis that a blue photon does not drive photosynthesis better because blue photons have more energy than green and red photons, and the extra energy in the blue photons is wasted as heat in the photosynthesis process.</li>

<li><strong>2700K has about 10% blue light, 4200K has about 20% blue light, 6500K has about 30% blue light.</strong> The greater the blue light content, the more compact the plant will be by reducing acid growth due to lower auxin levels. This is why people will say to use a higher color temperature in veging to suppress growth like stretching, and use lower color temperature in flowering to promote acid growth in flowering. Most higher end white LED grow lights are 3000K to 4000K.</li>

<li>Higher color temperature white LEDs will have a higher electrical efficiency, all else being equal, because less blue light is being captured by the phosphors, and the blue light emitted by the LED does not take a phosphor conversion loss hit. The total phosphor conversion loss for a white LED can be 5-20% (page 3, above paper). Because there is a higher conversion loss with lower color temperature LEDs, they will run a bit hotter than higher color temperature LEDs. Lower color temperature (and higher CRI) LEDs will also have greater total Stokes shift heating (the energy difference between the blue photon emitted from the blue LED and the other down converted photon from the phosphor is wasted as heat).</li>

<li>Some modern white LEDs may use five or more different phosphors or phosphors with multiple peaks, and I didn't really realize this until doing 1st and 2nd order derivative spectroscopic analysis on a dozen different types of Bridgelux white LEDs. The results can be seen here.. Early white LEDs were using a single yellow phosphor with blue LEDs and some still do.</li>

<li>A 'perfect' white light source would be right around 4.6 uMol/joule (it can vary a bit depending on the type of white). If you had a hypothetical 100% efficient array of color LEDs and a 100% LED driver to make white light, then you'll be around 4.6 uMol/joule, give or take a little. This is a theoretical limitation for white light no matter the white light source.</li></ul>"
